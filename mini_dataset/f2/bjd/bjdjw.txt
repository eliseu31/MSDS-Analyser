=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING:GASTROINTESTINAL
    IRRIT/NAUSEA/VOMIT/DIARRHEA. ASPIRATION OF MAT'L MAYCAUSE CHEM
    PNEUMONITIS. INHALATION: NOSE/THROAT IRRIT. HIGH CONCENTRATION MAY 
     CAUSE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION  CHAR BY
    HEADACHES/DIZZINESS/NAUSEA/CONFUSION. EYE: MAY CAUSE EYE IRRIT.
    SKIN: MAY CAUSE DEFATTING AND IRRITATION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NTP/IARC-CHROMIUM AND CERTAIN CHROMIUM
    COMPOUNDS.		 IARC-LEAD CHROMATE LISTED AS A POTENTIAL
    CARCINOGEN.
Effects of Overexposure:REPEATED EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA MAY
    CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS. OCCUPATIONAL	OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS ASSOC
    W/PERM BRAIN/NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. INSOLUBLE    CHROMATES MAY
    CAUSE LUNG CANCER. LEAD-BL OOD DAMAGE &
    NERVOUS/URINARY/REPRODUC-TIVE SYSTEMS. OVEREXPOSURE TO XYLENE MAY
    CAUSE INJURY TO LIVER/KIDNEYS/BLOOD.

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF BREATHING HAS STOPPED
    GIVE CPR/GET MED ATTN.EYE: FLUSH W/WATER FOR 15 MIN LIFTING
    UPPER/LOWER LIDS. GET MED ATTN. SKIN: WASHAFFECTED AREA WITH SOAP
    AND WATER. GET M EDICAL ATTENTION IF IRRITATION
    PERSISTS.SWALLOWING: CAN CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITATION, NAUSEA,
    AND VOMITING. ASPIRATION OF MATERIAL INTO LUNG MAY CAUSE CHEMICAL

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:>102F
Extinguishing Media:USE NFPA CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. POLYMER FOAM
    IS	      PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. USE
    WATER TO COOL CONTAINERS TO PREVENTPOSSIBLE
    AUTO-IGNITION/EXPLOSION. IF WATER IS USED FOG NOZZLES ARE
    PREFERRED.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:ISOLATE FROM HEAT/ELEC
    EQUIP/SPARKS/FLAME.CONTAINER MAY EXPLODE WHEN EXPOSED TO HEAT.
    OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMP PRODUCTS MAY CAUSE HEALTH HAZ. OBTAIN MED
    ATTN.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ELIM ALL IGNITION SOURCES. DIKE/CONTAIN SPILL
    WITHINERT MAT'L. TRANSFER LIQ'S/ABSORBENT DIKING MAT'LIN COVERED
    METAL CONT'S FOR RECOVERY/DISPOSAL. USEONLY NON-SPARKING TOOLS.
    PREVENT CONTAM OF SEWERS/ STREAMS/GROUNDWATER W/SPILLED MAT'L/USED
    ABSORBENT

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 120 DEGREES F.
    STORE LARGE     QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106.
Other Precautions:DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. CLOSE CONTAINER AFTER EACH
    USE. DO NOT BREATHE SANDING  DUST. EMPTY CONTAINERS MUST NOT BE
    WASHED AND RE-USED FOR ANY PURPOSE. 	 CONTAINERS SHOULD BE
    GROUNDED AND BONDED  TO THE RECEIVING CONTAINER.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:WELL VENTILATED AREA-USE NIOSH MECHANICAL FILTER
    RESPIRATOR. RESTRICTED VENTIL- LATION USE A NIOSH (COMBINATION CHEM
    CARTRIDGE/MECHAN FILTER) RESP. IN CONFINED AREAS USE NIOSH APPROVED
    AIR-SUPPLIED RE SPIRATOR.
Ventilation:PROVIDE GENERAL DILUTION/LOCAL EXHAUST, VENTILATION TO KEEP
    CONCENTRATIONS OF HAZARD INGREDIENTS BELOW EXPOSURE TLV.
Protective Gloves:SOLVENT IMPERMEABLE GLOVES.
Eye Protection:SAFETY SPEC W/SIDE SHIELDS. FACE SHIELD.
Other Protective Equipment:AS REQUIRED TO PREVENT SKIN CONTACT. SEE
    OSHA STANDARD FOR  LEAD.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH WITH SOAP AND WATER HANDS/FACE THOROUGHLY
    BEFORE	 EATING OR DRINKING.
Supplemental Safety and Health
SEE VENT. REQUIREMENT FOR LEAD: 29CFR1910.1025. DO NOT WELD, BRAZE OR
    CUT       ON EMPTY CONTAINER.  NEVER USE PRESSURE TO EMPTY
    CONTAINERS. DRUM IS NOT A PRESSURE VESSEL.
