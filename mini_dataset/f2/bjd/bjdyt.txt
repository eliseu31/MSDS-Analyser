=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:XYLENE MAY CAUSE INJURY TO LIVER,
    KIDNEYS & BLOOD. REPEATED OVEREXP TO TOLUENE MAY CAUSE LIVER
    DAMAGE. REPORTS HAVE ASSOCIATED PROLONGED/REPEATED OCCUPATIONAL
    OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS W/PERMANENT BRAI N & NERVOUS SYSTEM
    DAMAGE. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY DELIBERATELY CONCENTRATE/INHALING OF
    CONTENTS MAY BE HARMFUL EVEN FATAL
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:TOLUENE HAS BEEN FOUND TO CAUSE KIDNEY,
    LUNG AND SPLEEN DAMAGE IN LABORATORY ANIMALS.
Effects of Overexposure:SWALLOW:GASTROINTEST IRRIT,NAUSEA & VOMIT.
    ASPIRATION INTO LUNGS MAY CAUSE CHEM PNEUMONITIS CAN BE FATAL.
    INHALED:PROPANE IN EXCESS AMTS MAY INDIRECT CAUSE HEALTH HAZARD BY
    LIMITED OXYGEN. NOSE OR THR OAT IRRIT. HIGH CONCENTR-ACUTE CENTRAL
    NERV SYST

    IRRIT

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOW:DON'T INDUCE VOMIT. CALL PCC/EMERG ROOM/DOC IMMED.
    INHALED:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF BREATH STOPPED, GIVE CPR. KEEP WARM
    & QUIET. GET MED ATTN IMMED. EYES:FLUSH W/LG AMTS OF WTR, LIFTING
    LIDS AT  LEAST 15 MINS. GET MED ATTN. SKIN:REMOVE CONTAM CLOTHES,
    WASH AFFECTED AREA W/SOAP & WATER. OBTAIN MED ATTN IF IRRIT
    PERSIST.NOTE TO PHYSICIAN:TREATMENT DIRECT AT CONTROL OF
    SYMPT/CLINICAL CONDITIONS

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NR
Extinguishing Media:USE NFPA CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS FOR FLAMMABLE
    LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM IS PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIREFIGHTER SHOULD WEAR SCBA. USE WATER TO
    COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT PRESSURE
    BUILD-UP/AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION FROM EXTREME HEAT. FOG NOZZLES
    PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOS TO DECOMP PROD MAY CAUSE HEALTH
    HAZARD. SYMP MAY NOT BE IMMED APPARENT. OBTAIN MED ATTN. KEEP
    CONTAINERS TIGHTLY CLOSED, MAY EXPLODE FROM HEAT/FLAME.*

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR RSPRTR & BODY PROTECTION. KEEP SPECTATORS
    AWAY. ELIM ALL IGNITE SOURCES. DIKE & CONTAIN SPILL W/INERT
    MATERIAL(SAND,EARTH). TRANSFER LIQ TO COVERED METAL CONTAINERS FOR
    RECOVERY/DISPOSAL OR REMOV E W/INERT ABSORB. USE ONLY
    NON-SPARKINGTOOLS.***
Neutralizing Agent:N/K.***PLACE IN COVERED METAL CONTAIN FOR
    DISPOSAL.PREVENT CONTAM OF GROUNDWATER

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DON'T STORE ABOVE 95F. STORE LG AMTS
    IN COMPLIANCE W/OSHA 29CFR1910.106. EXPOSURE TO DIRECT SUNLIGHT OR
    OTHER HEAT MAY CAUSE CONTAIN TO RUPTURE/EXPLOD
Other Precautions:DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. CLOSE CONTAINER AFTER EACH
    USE. DO NOT PUNCTURE OR INCINERATE. DO NOT SPRAY NEAR FLAME OR HOT
    SURFACES. AVOID BREATHING VAPORS OR SPRAY MISTS. KEEP OUT OF REACH
    OF CHILDREN.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:WELL VENTED AREA ORGANIC CHEM MAY NOT REQUIRE
    USE OF RSPRTR. RESTRICTED VENT:CHEM CARTRIDGE RSPRTR MAY BE
    REQUIRED. SPRAY:USE MECH PREFILTER. CONFINED AREA:USE AIR SUPPLIED
    RSPRTR.IF TLV EXCEED USE PR OPERLY FITTED RSPRTR W/PROTECTION
