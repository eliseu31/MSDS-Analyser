=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:ORAL LD50 (RAT) = 167 MG/KG
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: MAY CAUSE EYE & SKIN
    IRRITATION. INHALATION MAY CAUSE RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION AND
    NARCOSIS. CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANT. LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS
    AND EVEN DEATH CAN OCCUR AT HIGH LEVELS  OF EXPOSURE. CHRONIC:
    PROLONGED OR REPEATED CONTACT WITH LIQUID ON THE SKIN CAN CAUSE
    IRRITATION AND DERMATITIS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:LISTED AS A SUSPECTED CARCINOGEN BY
    IARC. (2B)
Effects of Overexposure:HEADACHE, DIZZINESS, DROWSINESS, NAUSEA,
    TINGLING OR NUMBNESS OF THE EXTREMITIES, SENSES OF FULLNESS IN THE
    HEAD, SENSE OF WARMTH, STUPOR OR DULLNESS, LETHARGY AND DRUNKENESS.
    VERY HIGH CONCENTRATIONS  MAY LEAD TO UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR EVEN DEATH
    IN CONFINED OR POORLY VENTILATED AREAS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS METABOLIZED
    BY THE BODY TO CARBON MONOXIDE. THIS CAN BE SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE A
    SUBSTANTIAL STRESS ON THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM BY ELEVATED LEVELS
    OF CARBONYHEMOGLOBIN.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE CPR.
    IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. CALL A PHYSICIAN. EYE:
    FLUSH IMMEDIATELY WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. GET
    MEDICAL AT TENTION. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING. WASH WITH
    SOAP AND WATER PROMPTLY. INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GIVE
    MILK OR WATER TO DRINK ONLY IF CONSCIOUS. GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL
    ATTENTION.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:NONE
Lower Limits:12.0
Upper Limits:19.0
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, OR DRY CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FIRE OR EXCESSIVE HEAT MAY CAUSE
    PRODUCTION OF HAZARDOUS HYDROGEN CHLORIDE AND PHOSGENE GAS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SMALL SPILL: WIPE UP WITH RAGS OR TOWELS.
    LARGE SPILLS: EVACUATE AREA. WEAR NIOSH APPROVED RESPIRATOR.
    VENTILATE AREA. DIKE TO RETAIN FLUID. PUMP UP FREE LIQUID. RESIDUE
    WILL EVAPORATE QUICKLY. DO NOT  FLUSH TO SEWER OR WATERWAY.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED
    LOCATION, AWAY FROM ANY AREA WHERE THE FIRE HAZARD MAY BE ACUTE.
    KEEP CONTAINERS CLOSED WHEN NOT IN USE.
Other Precautions:METHYLENE CHLORIDE VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND
    WILL COLLECT IN LOW AREAS. THIS MATERIAL OR ITS VAPORS WHEN IN
    CONTACT WITH FLAMES, HOT GLOWING SURFACES OR ELECTRIC ARCS CAN
    DECOMPOSE TO FORM HYDRO GEN CHLORIDE GAS AND TRACES OF PHOSGENE.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IN HIGH VAPOR AREA, USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED
    RESPIRATOR WITH ORGANIC VAPOR CARTRIDGE. USE SELF-CONTAINED
    BREATHING APPARATUS IF VAPOR LEVELS EXCEED 1000 PPM. LONG-TERM OVER
    EXPOSURE MAY CAUSE LIVER/KID NEY DAMAGE.
Ventilation:LOCAL EXHAUST RECOMMENDED TO CONTROL VAPORS BELOW 50% OF
    TLV.
Protective Gloves:NEOPRENE, PVA GLOVES RECOMMENDED.
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES & FACE SHIELD.
Other Protective Equipment:APRON AND WORK CLOTHING TO MINIMIZE
    EXPOSURE. EYE WASH STATION & SAFETY SHOWER RECOMMENDED.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER USE AND BEFORE EATING,
    SMOKING OR USING TOILET FACILITIES. DO NOT BREATH VAPORS OR MIST.
Supplemental Safety and Health
TARGET ORGANS ARE SKIN, CNS, CVS, AND EYES.

    MANAGEMENT FACILITY. RECOVERED LIQUIDS MAY BE REPROCESSED OR
    INCINERATED OR MUST BE TREATED IN A  PERMITTED HAZARDOUS WASTE
    MANAGEMENT FACILITY.
