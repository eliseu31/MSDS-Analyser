=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:THESE CHEM ARE CNTND IN A SEALED CAN.
    RISK OF EXPOS ONLY IF THE CELL IS MECH OR ELEC ABUSED. THE MOST
    LIKELY RISK IS ACUTE EXPOS WHEN A CELL LEAKS. KOH IS CAUSTIC. SKIN
    CNTCT CAN PRODUCE BURNS. EYE CN TCT CAN RSLT IN SEV, PERM INJURY.
    AT ELEVATED TEMP MERCURY VAPS GENERATED CAN PRODUCE MERCURY INTOX.
    (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: SKIN & EYE CNTCT W/KOH MAY CAUSE CHEM
    BURNS. AT ELEVATED TEMPS, MERCURY VAP MAY BE GENERATED WHICH SHOULD
    NOT BE INHALED. MERCURY & MERCURY CMPNDS APPEAR ON NAVY LIST OF
    OCCUP CHEM REPROD HA Z. SEEK CONSULTATION FROM APPROP HLTH
    PROFESSIONALS CONCERNING LATEST HAZ LIST INFO & SAFE HNDLG & EXPOS
    INFO .
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:AN ACUTE EXPOSURE WILL NOT
    GENERALLY AGGRAVATE ANY MEDICAL CONDITION.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IF LEAKAGE FROM CELL COMES INTO CONT WITH THE SKIN, FLUSH
    IMMED WITH WATER. FOR EYE CONT, FLUSH EYES IMMED WITH COPIOUS OF
    WATER FOR FIFTEEN MIN AND SEE MD AT ONCE. FOR INHAL OF MERCURY
    VAPORS, REMOVE  TO FRESH AIR. INGEST: CALL MD IMMED .

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:EXTINGUISHING MEDIA SUITABLE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE .
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED
    SCBA & FULL PROT EQUIP WHEN CELLS ARE INVOLVED IN A FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CELLS MAY RELEASE TOXIC MERCURY VAPOR
    WHEN THE INTEGRITY OF THE CAN IS BROKEN.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:AVOID SKIN AND EYE CONTACT. DO NOT INHALE
    VAPORS.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:USE NEOPRENE, RUBBER OR LATEX NITRILE
    GLOVES WHEN HANDLING LEAKERS. STORE AT ROOM TEMPERATURE.
Other Precautions:AVOID MECH AND ELEC ABUSE. DO NOT RECHARGE. AVOID
    SHORT CIRCUITS. INSTALL CELLS IAW EQUIP INSTRUCTIONS. OBSERVE
    CORRECT POLARITY WHEN INSTALLING. DO NOT DISPOSE OF IN FIRE.
    REPLACE ALL BATTERIES IN EQ UIP AT SAME TIME. SEE SUPP DATA.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARTUS WHEN CELLS ARE
    INVOLVED IN FIRE.
Ventilation:SUBSEQUENT TO A FIRE, PROVIDE AS MUCH VENTILATION AS
    POSSIBLE.
Protective Gloves:NEOPRENE, RUBBER OR LATEX NITRILE.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES WHEN HANDLING LEAKERS.
