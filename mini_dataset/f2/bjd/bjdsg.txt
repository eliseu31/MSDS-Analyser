=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING MAY CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL
    IRRITATION & CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS. INHALATION MAY CAUSE NOSE/THROAT
    IRRITATION. MAY IRRITATE EYES, SKIN, & IF ABSORBED IN HARMFUL
    AMOUNTS, CAN CAUSE SKIN DEFATTIN G. OTHER EFFECTS: DAMAGE TO LIVER,
    KIDNEYS, BLOOD, LUNG DISEASE, PERMANENT BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM
    DAMAGE & DEATH.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:CRYSTALLINE MAY CAUSE LUNG DISEASE & HAS
    BEEN LISTED AS A CARCINOGEN BY THE IARC.
Effects of Overexposure:HEADACHES, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, CONFUSION,
    DEPRESSION & SEVERE IRRITATION REACTION IF PRODUCT IS SWALLOWED,
    INHALED, ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN, OR GETS INTO EYES.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS, DAMAGE TO
    LIVER, KIDNEYS & BLOOD, RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS, PERMANENT BRAIN &
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE & DEATH.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. CALL POISON CONTROL
    CENTER IMMEDIATELY. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY. IF
    BREATHING STOPPED, GIVE CPR & KEEP WARM & QUIET. EYE: FLUSH WITH
    LARGE AMOUN TS OF WATER FOR 15 MIN LIFTING UPPER/LOWER LIDS
    CONTINUOUSLY. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & WASH AFFECTED
    AREA WITH SOAP & WATER. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY
    OF THESE CONDITIONS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:24F/-4C
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, DRY CHEMICAL OR FOAM TO
    EXTINGUISH FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRES. USE POLYMER FOAM FOR LARGE
    FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE INEFFECTIVE BUT MAY BE USED TO
    COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS & PREVENT POSSIBLE AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION.
    FOG NOZZLES PREFERRED WHEN USING WATER.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS
    MAY CAUSE HEALTH HAZARD. SYMPTOMS MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.
    OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR RESPIRATORS, APPROPRIATE BODY PROTECTION.
    KEEP SPECTATORS AWAY. ELIMINATE ALL IGNITE SOURCES, CONTAIN SPILL
    W/INERT MATERIAL, TRANS LIQ TO COV METAL CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL.
    USE ONLY NON-SPARK TO OLS. PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF SEWERS &
    GROUNDWATER

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95 DEGREES F. STORE
    LARGE QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106.
Other Precautions:EMPTY CONTAINERS SHOULD NOT BE WASHED OR REUSED FOR
    ANY PURPOSE AND SHOULD BE GROUNDED & BONDED TO RECEIVING CONTAINER.
    DO NOT WELD, BRAZE OR CUT ON EMPTY CONTAINER. NEVER USE PRESSURE TO
    EMPTY. DISPO SE AS HAZARDOUS WASTE, IGNITABLE, D001.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS, RESPIRATORY PROTECTION
    MAY NOT BE REQUIRED. IN RESTRICTED AREAS USE A NIOSH APPROVED
    CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE RESPIRATOR. FOR SPRAYING USE MECH PREFILTER. IN
    CONFINED AREAS USE NIO SH/MSHA APPR AIR SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:DILUTE & LOCAL EXHAUST RECOMMENDED TO CONTROL CONCENTRATE
    OF HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS.
Protective Gloves:WEAR SOLVENT IMPERMEABLE GLOVES.
Eye Protection:WEAR SAFETY SPECTACLES.
Work Hygienic Practices:EYEWASH FACILITY, SAFETY SHOWER. DO NOT TAKE
    INTERNALLY. CLOSE CONTAINER AFTER EACH USE & DO NOT BREATHE SANDING
    DUST.
