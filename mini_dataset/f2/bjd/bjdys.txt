=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:REPORTS HAVE ASSOCIATED
    PROLONGED/REPEATED OCCUPATIONAL OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS
    W/PERMANENT BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY
    DELIBERATELY CONCENTRATING & INHALING THE CONTENTS MAY  BE HARMFUL
    OR FATAL. NOTE TO PHYSICIAN:TREATMENT FOR OVEREXPOSURE DIRECTED AT
    CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS/CLINICAL CONDITIONS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:AT THE TLV THE TIO2 MANUFACTURER
    CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARD FOR MAN. SEE FILE FOR
    MORE INFORMATION.
Effects of Overexposure:SWALLOW: GASTROINTESTINAL IRRIT, NAUSEA &
    VOMITING. ASPIRATION INTO LUNGS MAY CAUSE CHEM PNEUMONITIS, CAN BE
    FATAL. INHALE:NOSE OR THROAT IRRIT. HIGH CONCENTRATE MAY CAUSE
    ACUTE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM  DEPRESSION, CHARACTERIZED BY
    HEADACHE,DIZZINESS, NAUSEA & CONFUSION. EYES: IRRIT. SKIN: MAY
    CAUSE DEFATTING & IRRIT.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOW: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. CALL POISON CONTROL
    CENTER/EMERGENCY ROOM/PHYSICIAN IMMED. INHALED: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR
    IMMED. IF BREATHING STOPPED, GIVE CPR. KEEP WARM & QUIET. GET MED
    ATTN IMMED. E YES: FLUSH W/LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER, LIFTING LIDS FOR
    AT LEAST 15 MINUTES, GET MED ATTN. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED
    CLOTHING, WASH AREAS W/SOAP & WATER. OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION IF
    IRRIT PERSIST.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:>102F/>39C
Extinguishing Media:USE NFPA CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS FOR FLAMMABLE
    LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM IS PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIREFIGHTER SHOULD WEAR SCBA. USE WATER TO
    COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT PRESSURE
    BUILD-UP/AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION FROM EXTREME HEAT. FOG NOZZLES
    PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOS TO DECOMP PROD MAY CAUSE HEALTH
    HAZARD. SYMP MAY NOT BE IMMED APPARENT. OBTAIN MED ATTN. KEEP
    CONTAINERS TIGHTLY CLOSED, MAY EXPLODE FROM HEAT/FLAME.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:KEEP SPECTATORS AWAY. ELIM ALL IGNITE SOURCES.
    DIKE & CONTAIN SPILL W/INERT MATERIAL(SAND,EARTH). TRANSFER LIQ TO
    COVERED METAL CONTAIN FOR RECOVERY/DISPOSAL OR REMOVE W/INERT
    ABSORB. USE ONLY NON-SPA RK TOOLS.PREVENT CONTAM OF
    SEWER/STREAMS/GROUNDWTR

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95 DEGREES F. STORE
    LARGE QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106.
Other Precautions:DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. CLOSED CONTAINER AFTER EACH
    USE. EMPTY CONTAINERS MUST NOT BE WASHED AND REUSED FOR ANY
    PURPOSE. CONTAINERS SHOULD BE GROUNDED & BONDED TO THE RECEIVING
    CONTAINER. DO NOT WELD,  BRAZE OR CUT ON EMPTY CONTAINERS. *

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

    USE OF RSPRTR. RESTRICTED VENT:CHEM CARTRIDGE RSPRTR MAY BE
    REQUIRED. SPRAY:USE MECH PREFILTER. CONFINED AREA:USE AIR SUPPLIED
    RSPRTR.IF TLV EXCEED USE PR OPERLY FITTED RSPRTR W/PROTECTION
    FACTOR
Ventilation:GEN DILUTE & LOCAL EXHAUST VENT IN SUFFIC VOL/PATTERN TO
    MAINTAIN CONCENTR OF HAZARD SUBSTANCE BELOW LOWEST EXPOS LIMIT
Protective Gloves:IMPERMEABLE FOR REPEAT/PROLONGED CONTACT
Eye Protection:WEAR SAFETY SPECTACLES.
Other Protective Equipment:NOT LIKELY TO BE NEEDED.
Supplemental Safety and Health
* NEVER USE PRESSURE TO EMPTY. DRUM IS NOT A PRESSURE VESSEL. IT IS
    HIGHLY UNLIKELY THESE TLV LIMITS WILL BE EXCEEDED WITH OUTDOOR
