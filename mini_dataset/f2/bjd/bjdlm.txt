Flash Point:55.0F,12.8C
Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:798F
Lower Limits:3.3
Upper Limits:19
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY CHEMICAL. A WATER
    SPRAY IS NOT RECOMMENDED AS AN EXTINGUISHING AGENT.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:ETHYL ALCOHOL IS A DANGEROUS FIRE AND
    EXPLOSION HAZARD WITH A LOW FLASH POINT, APPRECIABLE VAPOR
    PRESSURE, AND A SIGNIFICANT EXPLOSIVE RANGE IN AIR.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:NOTIFY SAFETY PERSONNEL OF SPILL/LEAK. PROVIDE
    MAXIMUM EXPLOSION-PROOF VENTILATION. ELIMINATE ALL SOURCES OF
    IGNITION. WEAR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. CONTAIN LARGE SPILL FOR VACUUM
    PICK-UP. CONSIDER WATER  DILUTION. ABSORB SMALL AMOUNTS W/
    INERTMATERIAL.
Neutralizing Agent:NOT APPLICABLE.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:PROTECT CONTAINERS FROM PHYSICAL
    DAMAGE. STORAGE AND USE CONDITIONS MUST BE SUITABLE FOR AN OSHA
    CLASS IB FLAMMABLE LIQUID.
Other Precautions:MAKE FREQUENT CAREFUL LEAKAGE INSPECTIONS. ISOLATE
    FROM OXIDEZERS, CHEMICALS CAPABLE OF SPONTANEOUS HEATING, MATERIALS
    REACTING WITH AIR OR MOISTURE TO LIBERATE HEAT, IGNITION SOURCES
    AND EXPLOSIVES.  KEEP OUT OF DIRECT SUN & AWAY FROM HEAT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF VENTILATION DOES NOT MAINTAIN INHALATION
    EXPOSURES BELOW PEL(TLV), USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED RESPIRATORS.
    RESPIRATORS SHOULD BE SELECTED BASED ON THE FORM AND CONCENTRATION
    OF CONTAMINANT IN AIR & IN	ACCORDANCE WITH OSHA (29 CFR 1910.134).
Ventilation:USE BOTH GENERAL AND LOCAL NONSPARKING, EXPLOSION-PROOF
    EXHAUST VENTILATION TO MAINTAIN AIRBORNE LEVELS BELOW TLV/PEL.
Protective Gloves:WEAR IMPERVIOUS GLOVES
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES/CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES.
Other Protective Equipment:WEAR RUBBER BOOTS, APRONS, AND OTHER
    APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SUITABLE TO THE WORK
    SITUATION.
Work Hygienic Practices:PRACTICE GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE. KEEP MATERIAL
    OFF CLOTHES AND EQUIPMENT. DO NOT SMOKE ANYWHERE NEAR WORK AREA.
Supplemental Safety and Health
AVOID REPEATED OR PROLONGED SKIN CONTACT OR INHALATION OF VAPORS. USE
    ONLY WITH ADEQUATE VENTILATION AND ELIMINATE ALL SOURCES OF
    HAZARDOUS OR UNINTENDED IGNITION. EXPOSURE TO ETHYL ALCOHOL
    ENHANCES T OXICITY HAZARDS OF OTHER MATERIALS SUCHAS CHLORINATED
    HYDROCARBON SOLVENTS OR DRUGS. WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER USE.
