=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:OVEREXP TO TOLUENE MAY CAUSE LIVER
    DAMAGE. N-HEXANE:DAMAGE TO PERIPHERAL NERV SYST. LEAD MAY RESULT IN
    SEV DAM TO BLOOD FORMING,NERVOUS,URINARY & REPROD SYSTEM. LEADING
    TO LOSS OF APPETITE,METALLIC TA
    STE,ANXIETY,CONSTIPATION,NAUSEA,WEAK,INSOMNIA,HEADACHE,MUSCLE/JOINT
    PAIN, FINE TREMORS,NUMB,DIZZ,HYPERACTIVE & COLIC
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:AT THE TLV THE TIO2 MANUFACTURER
    CONCLUDES THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT HAZARD FOR MAN.
Effects of Overexposure:SWALLOW: GASTROINTEST IRRIT, NAUSEA, VOMIT.
    ASPIRATION INTO LUNGS MAY CAUSE CHEM PNEUMON, CAN BE FATAL.
    INHALED: NOSE OR THROAT IRRIT. HIGH CONCENTRATE, ACUTE CENTRAL NERV
    SYST DEPRESS, HEADACHES, DIZ Z, NAUSEA & CONFUSION. EYES:IRRIT.
    SKIN:IRRIT & DEFATT. PROLONGED/REPEATED OVEREXP W/PERMANENT BRAIN &
    NERV SYST DAMAGE
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PREXISTING KIDNEY CONDITIONS MAY BE
    AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURES TO LEAD.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INGEST:DON'T INDUCE VOMIT, CALL PCC/HOSPITAL/DOC IMMED.
    INHALE:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMED. IF BREATH STOPPED, GIVE CPR. KEEP
    WARM & QUIET. GET MED ATTN IMMED. EYES:FLUSH W/LG AMTS OF WATER,
    LIFTING LID S AT LEAST 15 MINS. GET MED ATTN. SKIN:FLUSH CONTAM
    AREA W/LG AMTS OF WATER. REMOVE CONTAM CLOTHES AS WATER IS APPLIED.
    CONSULT MED. NOTE:TREATMENT DIRECT AT CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS &
    CLINICAL CONDITIONS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:13F/-10C
Extinguishing Media:USE NFPA CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS DESIGNED FOR
    FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM IS PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIREFIGHTER SHOULD WEAR SCBA. USE WATER TO
    COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT PRESSURE
    BUILD-UP/AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION FROM EXTREME HEAT. FOG NOZZLES
    PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOS TO DECOMP PROD MAY CAUSE HEALTH
    HAZARD. SYMP MAY NOT BE IMMED APPARENT. OBTAIN MED ATTN. KEEP
    CONTAINERS TIGHTLY CLOSED, MAY EXPLODE FROM HEAT/FLAME.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR RSPRTR/BODY PROTECTION. KEEP SPECTATORS
    AWAY. ELIM ALL IGNITE SOURCES. DIKE & CONTAIN W/INERT MATERIAL.
    TRANSFER LIQ TO COVERED METAL CONTAINER FOR RECOVERY/DISPOSAL OR
    REMOVE W/INERT ABSORB. USE	ONLY NON-SPARK TOOLS.PREVENT CONTAM
    OFSEWERS,ETC

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95 DEG F. STORE
    LARGE QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106. CLOSE
    CONTAINER AFTER EACH USE. KEEP AWAY FROM CHILDREN.
Other Precautions:DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. DO NOT BREATHE SANDING DUST.
    WASH HANDS & FACE THOROUGHLY BEFORE EATING OR DRINKING. EMPTY
    CONTAINERS MUST NOT BE WASHED & RE-USED FOR ANY PURPOSE. CONTAINERS
    MUST BE GROUNDED  & BONDED TO RECEIVING CONTAINER.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:GEN EXPOS TO ORGANIC CHEM MAY NOT REQUIRE RSPRTR
    IF USED IN WELL VENTED AREA. RESTRICTED VENT:ORGANIC VAPOR RSPRTR.
    SPRAYING:MECH PREFILTER. CONFINED AREAS OR HIGH EXPOS:AIR SUPPLIED
    RSPRTR. TLV/PEL A RE EXCEEDED USE PROPERLY FITTED RSPRTR.
Ventilation:GEN DILUTION/LOCAL EXHAUST VENT IN SUFFICIENT VOL/PATTERN
    TO MAINTAIN CONCENTRATE OF HAZARD SUBSTANCE BELOW LOWEST LIMIT
Protective Gloves:SOLVENT IMPERMEABLE GLOVES.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES, CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:EYEWASH FACILITY, SAFETY SHOWER. AS REQUIRED
    TO PREVENT SKIN CONTACT. SEE OSHA STANDARDS FOR LEAD.
Supplemental Safety and Health
DO NOT WELD, BRAZE OR CUT ON EMPTY CONTAINER. NEVER USE PRESSURE TO
    EMPTY. DRUM IS NOT A PRESSURE VESSEL. THIS PRODUCT, IF DISCARDED
    DIRECTLY, WOULD BE CLASSIFIED A HAZARDOUS WASTE BASED ON ITS IGNITA
    BILITY CHARACTERISTIC. THE PROPER RCRA CLASSIFICATION WOULD BE
    D001. SEE FILE FOR MORE INFORMATION.
