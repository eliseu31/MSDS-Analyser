    GASES OR DUST MAY RESULT IN DISCOMFORT SUCH AS DIZZINESS, NAUSEA,
    FEVER, DRYNESS AND/OR IRRITATION OF NOSE, THROAT AND EYES. SKIN
    SENSITIVITY MAY ALSO BE NOTED. A CUTE EXPOSURE FROM SOME TOXIC
    GASES MAYCAUSE PULMONARY EDEMA, ASPHYXIATION AND EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE
    CAN BE FATAL.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NICKEL AND CHROMIUM ARE CONSIDERED
    POSSIBLE CARCINOGENS.
Effects of Overexposure:EXPOSURE TO WELDING FUMES MAY RESULT IN
    DISCOMFORT SUCH AS DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, FEVER, DRYNESS AND/OR
    IRRITATION OF NOSE, THROAT AND EYES. SKIN SENSITIVITY MAY ALSO BE
    NOTED. WATERY EYES, HEADACHE, BREA THING DIFFICULTY, FREQUENT
    COUGHING AND/OR CHEST PAINS MAY OCCURE FROM ACUTE EXPOSURE. TOXIC
    GASES CAN BE FATAL.

    PRE-EXISTING CONDITION OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS BECAUSE OF THE
    WIDE VARIATION IN INDIVIDUAL SUSCEPTIBILITIES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IN CASE OF ELECTRICAL SHOCK, TURN OFF POWER PRIOR TO REMOVAL
    FROM EXPOSURE AREA AND ADMINISTRATION OF FIRST AID. REMOVE FROM
    EXPOSURE AREA AND CALL FOR MEDICAL AID. ADMINISTER OXYGEN IF
    BREATHING IS D IFFICULT. IF NOT BREATHING, BEGIN ARTIFICIAL
    RESPIRATION. IF NO DETECTABLE PULSE, BEGIN EXTERNAL HEART MASSAGE.
    EMPLOY FIRST AID TECHNIQUES RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN RED CROSS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Extinguishing Media:NON-FLAMMBLE;USE SUITABLE MEDIA FOR SURROUNDING
    FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NOT EXPECTED

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:CLEAN UP ANY GRINDING DUST OR WASTE RESIDUES
    AND PLACE IN SUITABLE DOT APPROVED CONTAINERS AND DISPOSE OF IN
