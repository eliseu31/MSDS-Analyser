Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: DISCOMFORT-DIZZINESS, NAUSEA,
    DRYNESS OR IRRITATION OF NOSE, THROAT, OR EYES. CHRONIC: SIDEROSIS
    (IRON DEPOSITS IN LUNGS) AND BELIEVED BY SOME INVESTIGATORS TO
    AFFECT PULMONARY FUNCTION. ARC RA YS CAN INJURE EYES AND BURN SKIN.

Explanation of Carcinogenicity:CHROMIUM AND NICKEL METALS & CMPDS ARE
    LISTED AS POTENTIAL CARCINOGENS BY NTP, IARC, & OSHA.
Effects of Overexposure:SEE HEALTH HAZARDS
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:RESPIRATORY OR ALLERGIC CONDITIONS
    MAY AFFECT SOMEEXPOSED INDIVIDUALS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:REMOVE FROM EXPOSURE AND GET MD. IF VICTIM IS UNCONSCIOUS,
    ADMINISTER OXYGEN. IF NOT BREATHING, RESUSCITATE IMMEDIATELY.
    EMPLOY FIRST AID TECHNIQUE RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN RED CROSS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:(NONFLAMMABLE)-WELDING ARC AND SPARKS CAN IGNITE
    COMBUSTIBLES AND FLAMMABLES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:REFER TO AMERICAN NATIONAL Z49.1 FOR FIRE
    PREVENTION DURING THE USE OF WELDING AND ALLIED PROCEDURES.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:MOLTEN METAL,SPKS,SLAG,&HOT SURFS CAN
    CAUSE FIRE OR EXPLO/PRECAUT MEASURES ARE NOT USED.DO NOT WELD IN
    SPACES CONTAINING FLAMM GASES,VAPORS,LIQUIDS OR DUSTS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:TRAIN WELDER TO AVOID ELEC SHOCK BY
    MAINTAINING A DRY WORK AREA,INSULATING HIMSELF FROM WORK AND
    GROUND,&NOT TOUCHING LIVE ELEC PARTS.AVOID BREATHING.
Other Precautions:WELDING HAZS ARE COMPLEX.AVAIL ACCIDENT&HEALTH
    RECORDS SHOW THAT GREAT MAJORITY OF RECORDED PROBLEMS RESULT FROM
    PHYSICAL ACCIDENTS(SOMETIMES DUE TO ELEC SHOCK OR RESTRICTED
    VISIBILITY(MOBILITY),PHYSI CAL STRAINS,RAD BURNS SUCH AS EYE FLASH.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE RESPIRABLE FUME RESP OR AIR-SUPPLIED RESP
    WHENWELDING IN CONFINED SPACE OR WHERE LOCAL EXHAUST OR VENT. DOES
