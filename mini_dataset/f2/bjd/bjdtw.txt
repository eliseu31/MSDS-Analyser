=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING MAY CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL
    IRRITATION & CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS. INHALATION MAY CAUSE NOSE/THROAT
    IRRITATION & ACUTE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION. MAY ALSO
    IRRIT EYES, SKIN & IF ABSORBED  IN HARMFUL AMTS, CAN CAUSE SKIN
    DEFATTING. OTHER EFFECTS: LIVER DAMAGE, PERMANENT BRAIN & NERVOUS
    SYSTEM DAMAGE & DEATH.
Effects of Overexposure:HEADACHES, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, VOMITING,
    CONFUSION & SEVERE IRRITATION REACTION IF PRODUCT IS SWALLOWED,
    INHALED, ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN, OR GETS INTO EYES.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS, ACUTE CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION, LIVER DAMAGE, RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS,
    PERMANENT BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE & DEATH.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. CALL POISON CONTROL
    CENTER IMMEDIATELY.  INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY.
    IF BREATHING STOPPED, GIVE CPR & KEEP WARM & QUIET. EYE: FLUSH WITH
    LARGE AMOU NTS OF WATER FOR 15 MIN LIFTING UPPER/LOWER LIDS
    CONTINUOUSLY. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & WASH AFFECTED
    AREA WITH SOAP & WATER. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY
    OF THESE CONDITIONS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:24F/-4C
Lower Limits:SEE INGRED.
Upper Limits:SEE INGRED.
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY CHEMICAL TO
    EXTINGUISH FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM PREFERRED FOR LARGE
    FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE INEFFECTIVE, BUT USED TO COOL
    EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT PRESS BUILDUP & POSSIBLE
    AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION. IF WATER USED, FOG NOZZLES PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS
    MAY CAUSE HEALTH HAZARD.  SYMPTOMS MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.
     OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:KEEP SPECTATORS AWAY. ELIMINATE ALL IGNITE
    SOURCES, CONTAIN SPILL WITH INERT MATERIAL, TRANSFER LIQUID TO
    COVERED METAL CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL. USE ONLY NON-SPARK TOOLS.
    PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF SEWE RS, STREAMS & GROUNDWATER.
