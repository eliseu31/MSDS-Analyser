Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:REPEATED EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE
    SILICA MAY CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS, A PROGRESSIVELY DISABLING LUNG
    DISEASE. SEE FILE FOR MORE INFO. NOTE TO PHYSICIAN:PRINCIPAL TOXIC
    EFFECTS OF ETHYLENE GLYCOL, WHEN SWA LLOWED ARE KIDNEY DAMAGE &
    METABOLIC ACIDOSIS. ETHANOL IS ANTIDOTAL. SEE FILE FOR MORE
    INFORMATION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:IARC CONSIDERS CRYSTALLINE SILICA TO
    HAVE LIMITED EVIDENCE OF CARCINOGENS IN HUMANS & SUFFICIENT
    EVIDENCE IN LAB ANIMALS
Effects of Overexposure:SWALLOW: ETHYLENE GLYCOL MAY CAUSE ABDOMINAL
    DISCOMFORT, PAINT, DIZZ, MALAISE, LUMBAR PAINT, OLIGURIA, UREMIA,
    CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESS. SEVERE KIDNEY DAMAGE FROM
    SWALLOWING LARGE AMOUNTS & MAY  BE FATAL. INHALED: RESPIRATORY
    IRRITATION. EYES: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION. SKIN: MAY CAUSE DEFATTING &
    IRRITATION OF SKIN.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PREXISTING RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS
    MAY BE AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOW:IMMED GIVE 1 OR 2 GLASSES OF WATER & CALL PCC/EMERG
    ROOM/PHYSICIAN FOR WAY TO INDUCE VOMIT.(NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY
    MOUTH TO AN UNCONSC PERSON). INHALED:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.

    LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM IF PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIREFIGHTER SHOULD WEAR SCBA. USE WATER TO
    COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT PRESSURE
    BUILD-UP/AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION FROM EXTREME HEAT. FOG NOZZLES
    PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS
    MAY CAUSE A HEALTH HAZARD. SYMPTOMS MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY
    APPARENT. OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION.
