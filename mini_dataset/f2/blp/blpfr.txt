======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORAGE-STORE IN A
    COOL,DRY,WELL-VENTILATED AREA.
Other Precautions:METHYLENE CHLORIDE VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND
    WILL COLLECT IN LOW AREAS. THIS MATERIAL OR ITS VAPORS WHEN IN
    CONTACT WITH FLAMES, HOT GLOWING SURFACES OR ELECTRIC ARCS CAN
    DECOMPOSE TO FORM HYDRO GEN CHLORIDE GAS AND TRACES OF PHOSGENE.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE WITH ADEQUATE VENTILATION. IN HIGH VAPOR
    AREA, USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED RESPIRATOR WITH ORGANIC VAPOR
    CARTRIDGE. FOR HIGH CONCENTRATIONS AND OXYGEN-DEFICIENT
    ATMOSPHERES, USE POSITIVE PRESSURE AIR- SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:LOCAL EXHAUST RECOMMENDED. VENTILATE LOW-LYING AREAS WHERE
    DENSE VAPORS MAY COLLECT.
Protective Gloves:POLYFLUORINATED POLYETHYLENE
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SPLASH GOGGLES/FULL FACESHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:APRON AND WORK CLOTHING TO MINIMIZE
    EXPOSURE. EYE WASH STATION & SAFETY SHOWER RECOMMENDED.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER USE AND BEFORE EATING,
    SMOKING OR USING TOILET FACILITIES. DO NOT BREATH VAPORS OR MIST.
Supplemental Safety and Health
NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS METABOLIZED TO CARBON
    MONOXIDE; WHICH THEN REACTS WITH HEMOGLOBIN TO FORM
    CARBOXYHEMOGLOBIN AND REDUCES THE OXYGEN-CARRYING CAPACITY OF THE
    BLOOD. DO NOT BREAT HE VAPORS/MISTS. AVOID CONTACT WITH EYES AND
    SKIN. AVOID CONTACT WITH FLAMES. FOR INDUSTRIAL USE ONLY.
