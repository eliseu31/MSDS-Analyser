=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:(CONC.= 2 - 3%) SIMPLE ASPHYXIA.
    (CONC.= 3 - 5%) INCREASED IRRITATION AND HEADACHE. (CONC.UP TO 15%)
    HEADACHE, NAUSEA, VOMITING AND UNCONSCIOUSNESS. HIGHER
    CONCENTRATIONS CAUSE CIRCULATORY INSUFFICIEN CY LEADING TO COMA AND
    DEATH.  CO2 IS THE MOST POWERFUL CEREBRAL VASODILATOR KNOWN. SOLID
    CO2 CAN CAUSE FROSTBITE.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NONE OF THE CHEMICALS IN THIS PRODUCT IS
    LISTED BY IARC, NTP OR OSHA AS A CARCINOGEN.
Effects of Overexposure:RAPID BREATHING, IRRITATED NOSE AND THROAT, AND
    WATERY EYES CAUSED BY THE FORMATION OF CARBONIC ACID, A VERY WEAK
    ACID.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONNEL WITH PRE-EXISTING CHRONIC
    RESPIRATORY DISEASES OF HEART DISORDER SHOULD REFRAIN FROM
    BREATHING EXCESSIVE CARBON DIOXIDE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:CONSCIOUS PERSONS OVER-EXPOSED TO CARBON DIOXIDE SHOULD BE
    ASSISTED TO AN AREA OF FRESH AIR.  UNCONSCIOUS PERSONS SHOULD BE
    MOVED TO AN AREA OF FRESH AIR.  GIVE APPROPRIATE BREATHING
    ASSISTANCE SUCH A S OXYGEN OR ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.  SEEK MEDICAL
    ASSISTANTCE.  FROSTBITE SHOULD BE TREATED AS A BURN WITH PROMPT
    MEDICAL TREATMENT SOUGHT.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY
    CHEMICAL AS SUITABLE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FIRE FIGHTING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND A
    FULL FACED SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EVACUATE AREA. COOL
    FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS WITH WATER SPRAY.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:THE CONTENTS OF THIS PRODUCT ARE UNDER
    PRESSURE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:CLEAN UP PERSONNEL SHOULD WEAR SELF-CONTAINED
    BREATHING APPARATUS WITH FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND FULL FACE
