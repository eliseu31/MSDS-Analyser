    CONTAINERS OF NITRIC ACID.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS AND
    FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. USE WATER SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS
    AND EXPOSED STRUCTURES.  NITROGEN OXIDES MAY BE PRESENT FROM VENTED
    OR RUPTURED CONTAINE RS. IF A SOLID WATER STREAM IS ADDED, VIOLENT
    SPLATTERING CAN OCCUR, AND CONSIDERABLE HEAT MAY BE GENERATED.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================
