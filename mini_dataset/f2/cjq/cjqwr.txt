=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:NO  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: DUE TO THE SMALL SIZE OF THE
    INDIVIDUAL CYLINDER OF THIS PRODUCT NO UNUSUAL HEALTH EFFECTS FROM
    EXPOSURE TO THE PRODUCT ARE ANTICIPATED UNDER ROUTINE CIRCUMSTANCES
    OF USE. HOWEVER, CARBON MONOX IDE (A COMPONENT OF THES GAS MIXTURE)
    ISTOXIC TO HUMANS. SYMPTOMS OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING CAN
    DEVELOP GRADUALLY, OR CAN ARISE SUDDENLY, DEPENDING ON THE
    CONCENTRATION AND DURATION OF EXPOSURE. CH RONIC: THERE ARE
    CURRENTLY NO KNOWN ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS ASSOCIATED WITH CHRONIC
    EXPOSURE TO THIS GAS. TARGET ORGANS: RESPIRATORY SYSTEM, BLOOD
    SYSTEM, CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM, REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:THE COMPONENTS OF THIS GAS MIXTURE ARE
    NOT FOUND IN THE FOLLOWING LISTS: FEDERAL OSHA LIST, NTP, CAL/OSHA,
    AND IARC; THEREFORE ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE, NOR SUSPECTED TO BE,
    CANCER-CAUSING AGENTS BY T HESE AGENCIES.
Effects of Overexposure:OVER-EXPOSURE TO CARBON MONOXIDE CAN BE
    INDICATED BY THE LIPS AND FINGERNAILS TURNING BRIGHT RED. OTHER
    SYMPTOMS OF OVER-EXPOSURE CAN INCLUDE RESPIRATORY DIFFICULTY,
    HEADACHES, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, WH EEZING, HEADACHE, BLURRED
    VISION, MEMORYLOSS, DIZZINESS, INDIGESTION, NAUSEA, UNCONSCIOUSESS,
    AND DEATH.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NO UNUSUAL HEALTH EFFECTS
    ANTICIPATED, DUE TO SMALL CYLINDER SIZE. HOWEVER, PRE-EXISTING
    RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS MAY BE AGGRAVATED. CARBON MONOXIDE CAN
    AGGRAVATE SOME DISEASES OF CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IF ANY ADVERSE SYMPTOMS DEVELOPS AFTER OVER-EXPOSURE TO THIS
    PRODUCT, REMOVE VICTIM(S) TO FRESH AIR AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. ONLY
    TRAINED PERSONNEL SHOULD ADMINISTER SUPPLEMINTAL OXYGEN AND/OR
    CARDIO-P ULMONARY RESUSCITATION IF NECESSARY. GETMEDICAL ATTENTION.
    RESCUERS SHOULD BE TAKEN FOR MEDICAL ATTENTION IF NECESSARY. TAKE A
    COPY OF THE LABEL AND THE MSDS TO PHYSICIAN OR OTHER HEALTH
    PROFESSIONAL  WITH THE VICTIM(S).

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:NON-FLAMMABLE GAS MIXTURE. USE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA
    APPROPRIATE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTERS MUST WEAR
    SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS AND FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:THIS GAS MIXTURE IS NOT FLAMMABLE;
    HOWEVER, CONTAINERS. WHEN INVOLVED IN FIRE. MAY RUPTURE OR BURST IN
    THE HEAT OF THE FIRE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:DUE TO SMALL SIZE AND CONTENT OF CYLINDER, A
    RELEASE PRESENTS  LESS RISK OF AN OXYGEN DEFICIENT AND OTHER SAFETY
    HAZARDS THAN RELEASE FROM LARGER CYLINDER. RELEASES IN WHICH THE
    ATMOSPHERE IS UNKNOWN,  AND IN WHICH OTHER CHEMICALS ARE INVOLVED,
    EVACUATE AREA. PROPER PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE USED. IN CASE
    OF A LEAK, CLEAR AFFECTED AREA, PROTECT PEOPLE, AND RESPOND WITH
    TRAINED PERSONNEL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:FIRMLY SECURE CYLINDERS TO PREVENT
    FALLING OR BEING KNOCKED-OVER. CYLINDERS MUST BE PROTECTED FROM
    ENVIRONMENT AND PREFERABLY KEPT AT ROOM TEMPERATURE (ABOUT
    21C,70F). STORE CYLINDERS IN DRY, WELL-VEN TILATED AREAS, AWAY FROM
    HEAT, IGNITION,DIRECT SUNLIGHT. PROTECT CYLINDERS AGAINST PHYSICAL
    DAMAGE.
Other Precautions:IF LEAKING  FROM CYLINDER OR ITS VALVE, CONTACT
    SUPPLIER. BE AWARE OF SIGNS OF DIZZINESS OR FATIGUE; EXPOSURES TO
    FATAL CONCENTRATIONS OF THIS PRODUCT COULD OCCUR WITHOUT WARNING
    SYMPTOMS, DUE TO  OXY GEN DEFICIENCY. DO NOT ATTEMPT TO REPAIR,
    ADJUST, OR MODIFY CYLINDERS  OF CARBON MONOXIDE. CONTACT N EAREST
    DISTRIBUTOR.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NO SPECIAL RESPIRATORY PROTECTION IS REQUIRED
    UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCE OF USE. USE SUPPLIED AIR RESPIRATORY
    PROTECTION IF CARBON MONOXIDE LEVEL EXCEEDS ESTABLISHED EXPOSURE
    LIMITS AND OXYGEN LEVEL BE LOW 19.5% OR UNKNOWN DURING EMERGENCY
    RESPONSE TO A RELEASE OF THIS PRODUCT.
Ventilation:NO SPECIAL VENTILATION SYSTEMS OR ENGINEERING CONTROLS ARE
    NEEDED UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES OF USE.
Protective Gloves:NO SPECIAL PROTECTION IS NEEDED UNDER NORMAL
    CIRCUMSTANCES.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES.
Other Protective Equipment:NO SPECIAL PROTECTION IS NEEDED UNDER NORMAL
    CIRCUMSTANCES.
Work Hygienic Practices:BE AWARE OF SIGNS OF DIZZINESS OR FATIGUE. IF
    THERE IS A MALFUNCTION OR OTHER TYPE OF OPERATIONAL PROBLEM,
    CONTACT NEAREST DISTRIBUTOR IMMEDIATELY.
Supplemental Safety and Health
