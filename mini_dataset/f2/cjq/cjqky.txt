=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:SEE INGREDIENTS.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM. CHRONIC: MAY CAUSE NEUROPATHY SUCH AS INCREASED
    SWEATING, TINGLING AND WEAKNESS IN THE HANDS AND FEET. UNSTEADY
    GAIT AND DECREASED REFLEXES MAY A LSO BE OBSERVED. SUSPECTED CANCER
    AGENT: EITHER ACUTE OR CHRONIC EXPOSURE MAY LEAD TO WEAK OR ABSENT
    REFLEXES. AN EARLY SIGN OF OVEREXPOSURE IS PEELING OF THE SKIN OF
    THE FINGERTIPS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:ACRYLAMIDE: IARC MONOGRAPHS ON THE
    EVALUATION OF CARCINOGENIC RISK OF CHEMICALS TO MAN, VOLUME 60,
    PAGE 389, 1994: GROUP 2A. NTP 8TH ANNUAL REPORT ON CARCINOGENS,
    1998: ANTICIPATED TO BE HUMAN CARCINO GEN.
Effects of Overexposure:INHALED: AIRBORNE ACRYLAMIDE IS READILY
    ABSORBED THROUGH THE LUNG AND OVEREXPOSURE WILL PRODUCE SIGNS OF
    NEUROPATHY. CONTACT WITH EYES: SODIUM AZIDE: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION.
    ACRYLAMIDE: MAY CAUSE CONJUN CTIVAL EYE IRRITATION. ABSORBED
    THROUGHSKIN: ACRYLAMIDE: READILY ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN. MAY
    CAUSE DAMAGE TO THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. INGESTION:
    NEUROTOXICITY FROM A SINGLE INGESTION CAN RESULT  BUT IS MORE
    LIKELY TO OCCUR  AFTER REPEATED INGESTION OF SMALL AMOUNTS OVER A
    PERIOD OF SEVERAL DAYS OR WEEKS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR AT
