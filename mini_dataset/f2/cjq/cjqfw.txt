LD50 LC50 Mixture:SEE TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: INHALATION PRODUCES
    DAMAGING EFFECTS ON THE MOCOUS MEMBRANES AND UPPER RESPIRATORY
    TRACT. SYMPTOMS MAY INCLUDE IRRITATION OF THE NOSE AND THROAT, AND
    LABORED BREATHING. MAY CAUSE LUNG EDEM A, A MEDICAL EMERGENCY.
    INGESTION: CORROSIVE. SWALLOWING CAN CAUSE SEVERE BURNS OF THE
    MOUTH, THROAT, AND STOMACH, LEADING TO DEATH. CAN CAUSE SORE
    THROAT, VOMITING, DIARRHEA. CIRCULATORY COLLAPSE WIT H CLAMMY SKIN,
    WEAK AND RAPID PULSE, SHALLOW RESPIRATIONS, AND SCANTY URINE MAY
    FOLLOW INGESTION OR SKIN CONTACT. CIRCULATORY SHOCK IS OFTEN THE
    IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF DEATH. (EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:SULFURIC ACID (MIST): IARC MONOGRAPHS,
    VOLUME 54, PAGE 41, 1998: GROUP 1. ANIMAL: PULMONARY.
Effects of Overexposure:HEALTH HAZARDS: SKIN: CORROSIVE. SYMPTOMS OF
    REDNESS, PAIN, AND SEVERE BURNS CAN OCCUR. CIRCULATORY COLLAPSE
    WITH CLAMMY SKIN, WEAK AND RAPID PULSE, SHALLOW RESPIRATIONS, AND
    SCANTY URINE MAY FOLLOW S KIN CONTACT OR INGESTION. CIRCULATORY
    SHOCK IS OFTEN THE IMMEDIATE CAUSE OF DEATH. EYES: CORROSIVE.
    CONTACT CAN CAUSE BLURRED VISION, REDNESS, PAIN AND SEVERE TISSUE
    BURNS. CAN CAUSE BLINDNESS. CHRONI C: LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO MIST OR
    VAPOR MAY CAUSE DAMAGE TO TEETH. CHRONIC EXPOSURE TO MISTS
    CONTAINING SULFURIC ACID IS A CANCER HAZARD.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING SKIN
    DISORDERS OR EYE PROBLEMS OR IMPAIRED RESPIRATORY FUNCTION MAY BE
    MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF THE SUBSTANCE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IN ALL CASES, CALL MD IMMED. INHAL: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF
    NOT BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS
    DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. CALL MD IMMED. INGEST: DO NOT INDUCE VOMIT.
    GIVE LGE QTY S OF WATER. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO AN
    UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. CALL MD IMMED. SKIN: IMMED FLUSH W/PLENTY OF
    WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES WHILE REMOVING CONTAMINATED CLOTHING
    & SHOES. WASH CLOTHIN G BEFORE REUSE. EXCESS ACID ON SKIN CAN BE
    NEUTRALIZED W/2% SOLUTION OF BICARBONATE OF SODA. CALL MD IMMED.
    EYES: IMMED FLUSH W/GENTLE BUT LARGE STREAM OF WATER FOR AT LEAST
    15 MINUTES, LIFTING LOWER  & UPPER EYELIDS OCCAS. CALL MD IMMED.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:DRY CHEMICAL, FOAM OR CARBON DIOXIDE. DO NOT USE
    WATER ON MATERIAL. HOWEVER, WATER SPRAY MAY BE USED TO KEEP
    FIRE-EXPOSED CONTAINERS COOL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTER'S PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS
    INEFFECTIVE FOR FIRES INVOLVING THIS MATERIAL. STAY AWAY FROM
    SEALED CONTAINERS.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CONCENTRATED MATERIAL IS A STRONG
    DEHYDRATING AGENT. REACTS WITH ORGANIC MATERIALS AND MAY CAUSE
    IGNITION OF FINELY DIVIDED MATERIALS ON CONTACT. CONTACT WITH MOST
    METALS CAUSES FORMATION OF FLAMMABLE  AND EXPLOSIVE HYDROGEN GAS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENT AREA OF LEAK/SPILL. WEAR APPROP PERS PROT
    EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN CTL MEASURES SECTION. ISOLATE HAZ AREA. KEEP
    UNNEC & UNPROTECTED PERS FROM ENTERING. CONTAIN & RECOVER LIQ WHEN
    POSS. NEUTRALIZE W/ ALKALINE MATL (SODA ASH, LIME), THEN ABSORB
    W/INERT MATL (E.G., VERMICULITE, DRY SAND, EARTH), & PLACE IN CHEM
    WASTE CONTR. DO NOT USE COMBUST MATLS, SUCH AS SAWDUST. DO NOT
    FLUSH TO SEWER! (SUP DAT)
Neutralizing Agent:ALKALINE MATLS (SODA ASH, LIME). J.T. BAKER
    NEUTRASORB(TM)/TEAM(TM) 'LOW NA+' ACID NEUTRALIZERS ARE
    RECOMMENDED.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN COOL, DRY, VENTILATED STORAGE
    AREA W/ACID RESISTANT FLOORS & GOOD DRAINAGE. PROTECT FROM PHYSICAL
    DAMAGE. KEEP OUT OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT & AWAY FROM HEAT, WATER, &
    INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS. DO NOT  WASH OUT CONTAINER & USE IT FOR
    OTHER PURPOSES. KEEP CONTAINER CLOSED. USE ONLY W/ADEQ VENTILATION.
Other Precautions:WHEN DILUTING, ALWAYS ADD ACID TO WATER; NEVER ADD
    WATER TO ACID. WHEN OPENING METAL CONTAINERS, USE NON-SPARKING
    TOOLS BECAUSE OF POSSIBILITY OF HYDROGEN GAS BEING PRESENT.
    CONTAINERS MAY BE HAZARDOU S WHEN EMPTY SINCE THEY RETAIN PRODUCT
    RESIDUES (VAPORS, LIQUID); OBSERVE ALL WARNINGS & PRECAUTIONS 
    LISTED FOR PRODUCT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

    REGULATORY AGENCY/RESP SUPPLI ER, WHICHEVER IS LOWEST. FOR
    EMER/INSTANCES WHERE EXPOS LEVELS ARE NOT KNOWN, USE NIOSH APPRVD
    FULL-FACEPIECE POS-PRESS, AIR-SUPPLIED RESP. (SUP DAT)
Ventilation:A SYS OF LOC &/OR GEN EXHST IS REC TO KEEP EMPLOYEE EXPOS
    BELOW AIRBORNE EXPOS LIMS. LOC EXHST VENT IS GEN PREF BECAUSE IT
    CAN CONTROL EMISSIONS OF (SARA REGS)
