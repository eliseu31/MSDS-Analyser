=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:LD50 INGESTION RAT: > 5000 MG/KG
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:TARGET ORGANS: N/P. IRRITANT (EYE,
    SKIN, RESPIRATORY PASSAGES, SKIN SENSITIZERS). INHALATION (TLV)
    HARMFUL (ORAL) BASED ON AROMATIC PETROLEUM SOLVENT - IRRITANT
    (SKIN), HARMFUL (CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM  DEPRESSION,
    GASTROINTESTINAL DISTURBANCE). INGESTION: SEVERE GASTROINTESTINAL
    DISTURBANCE IS ASSOCIATED WITH INGESTION OF HYDROCARBON SOLVENT.
    INGESTION OF EXCESSIVE QUANTITIES CAN ALSO INDUCE SIGNS  OF CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION (E.G., DROWSINESS, DIZZINESS, LOSS OF
    COORDINATION, AND FATIGUE). SMALL AMOUNTS OF HYDROCARBON SOLVENT
    ASPIRATED INTO LUNGS DURING INGESTION OF VOMITING MAY INDUCE 
    SEVERE LUNG CONGESTION, COMA, AND DEATH
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:N/P. CONTAINS <2.0% SILICA, CRYSTALLINE
    (QUARTZ) CAS 14808-60-7 (HMIS).
Effects of Overexposure:LABOR BREATHING, COMA, DEATH, PROBABLY MILDLY
    IRRITATING TO EYES, MODERATELY SKIN IRRITANT AND MILD SENSITIZER,
    TINGLING, ITCHING, BURNING, PRICKLING, GLOWING, FLUSHING, NUMBNESS,
    CHAPPED FEELING. PRO BABLY NOT ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN. MODERATELY
    TOXIC BY INHALATION WITH SYMPTOMS OF HEAD ACHE, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA.
    INGESTION CAN INDUCE NAUSEA, VOMITING, ABDOMINAL PAIN, DIARRHEA

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IF IN EYES: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT
