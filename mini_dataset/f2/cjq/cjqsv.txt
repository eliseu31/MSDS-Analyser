Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE- SKIN: MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC
    DERMATITIS WITH PAPULAR FORMATION IN SUSCEPTABLE INDIVIDUALS, WHICH
    USUALLY OCCURS IN THE FOLD OF SKIN. MAY CAUSE ULCERS. EYES: MAY
    CAUSE IRRITATION. INGESTION: MAY CAU SE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
    DEPRESSION. INHALATION: MAY CAUSE RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION AND
    CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION.	CHRONIC- MAY CAUSE
    SENSITIZATION IN SUSCEPTABLE INDIVIDUALS EYES: CAN C AUSE CORNEAL
    DAMAGE, POLYCYTHEMIA, HYPERPLASIA OF THE THYROID GLAND, AND DAMAGE
    TO THE ALPHA CELLS OF THE PANCREAS. INHALATION: MAY CAUSE EMPYHSEMA
    OR PULMONARY FIBROTIC DISEASE. SKIN: MAY SPREAD TO T HE WHOLE BODY.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NICKEL & CHROMIUM HAVE BEEN DETERMINED
    TO CAUSE CANCER IN EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS (IARC, NTP). NICKEL IS
    LISTED AS A PROBABLE HUMAN CARCINGEN. CHROMIUM IS LISTED AS A HUMAN
    CARCINOGEN.
Effects of Overexposure:SKIN-MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC DERMATITIS, WITH
    REDNESS & PAPULAR FORMATION IN SUSCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS,  WHICH
    USUALLY OCCURS IN THE FOLDS OF THE SKIN. MAY CAUSE ULCERS
    PROGRESSING TO DRY & SCALY SKIN, FEVER . EYE-MAY CAUSE IRRITATION,
    EXPERIENCED AS REDNESS & EXCESS REDNESS OF THE CONJUNCTIVA.
    SWALLOWING-MAY CAUSE NAUSEA, ABDOMIAL PAIN, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, CNS
    DEPRESSION, & BURNING SENSATION. INHALATION- MAY CAUSE RESPIRATORY
    TRACT IRRITATION, WITH CHEST PAIN, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, BURNING
    SENSATION, & CNS DEPRESSION. MAY ALSO CAUSE INTERSTITIAL
    PNEUMONITIS & SENSITIZATION OF THE RESPIRATORY TRACT IN SU
    SCEPTIBLE INDIVIDUALS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:BREATHING OF DUST MAY AGGRAVATE
    ASTHMA AND INFLAMMATORY OR FIBROTIC PULMONARY DISEASE. MAY ALSO
    AGGRAVATE AN EXISTING DERMATITIS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING-GIVE AT LEAST 2 GLASSES OF MILK OR WATER. INDUCE
    VOMITING, UNLESS PATIENT IS UNCONSCIOUS. CALL A PHYSICIAN.
