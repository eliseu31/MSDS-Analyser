=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:USE ANY MEANS SUITABLE FOR EXTINGUISHING
    SURROUNDING FIRE. WATER SPRAY MAY BE USED TO KEEP FIRE EXPOSED
    CONTAINERS COOL
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPRVD SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CONTACT WITH OXIDIZABLE SUBSTANCES &
    INCOMPATIBLES MAY CAUSE EXTREMELY VIOLENT COMBUSTION. FIRE: NOT
    COMBUSTIBLE, BUT SUBSTANCE IS A STRONG OXIDIZER AND ITS HEAT OF
    REACTION WITH REDUCING AGENTS OR CO MBUSTIBLES MAY CAUSE IGNITION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:NOTIFY SFTY PERSONNEL OF IODINE SPILL/LEAKS.
    VENTILATE AREA OF LEAK/SPILL. WEAR PROT EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN EXPOS
    CTLS/PERSONAL PROT SECTION 8. ISOLATE HAZ AREA. KEEP UNNEC &
    UNPROTECTED PERSONNEL FROM	ENTERING. COLLECT & CONTAINERIZE AS
    MUCH SOLID IODINE AS POSS. COVER SPILL AREA W/EXCESS OF REDUCING
    AGENT (SODIUM THIOSULFATE, BISULFATE/FERROUS SALTS IN 3M SULFURIC
    ACID) AND (SUPDAT)
Neutralizing Agent:SODA ASH.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN TIGHTLY CLSD CNTNR. STORE IN
    COOL, DRY, VENTD AREA AWAY FROM SOURCES OF HEAT/IGNIT. PROTECT
