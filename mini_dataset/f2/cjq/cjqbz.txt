=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:TWA (8 HOUR)=1000 PPM.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EXCESSIVE INHALATION OF VAPORS MAY BE
    FATAL. VAPORS REDUCE AVAILABLE OXYGEN IN AIR. REDUCED OXYGEN LEVELS
    TO 12-14% PRODUCE SYMPTOMS OF ASPHYXIATION.  MATERIAL CAN INDUCE
    CARDIAC SENSITIZATION TO EPIN EPHRINE AND CARDIAC ARRHYTHMIA.  SKIN
    IRRITANT.  DIRECT EXPOSURE OF SKIN TO LIQUID MAY CAUSE FROSTBITE. 
    EYE IRRITANT.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT LISTED.
Effects of Overexposure:INHALATION:SYMPTOMS OF ASPHYXIATION;LOSS OF
    COORDINATION, INCREASED PULSE RATE, CARDIAC SENSITIZATION, DEEPER
    RESPIRATION. SKIN:IRRITATION, FROSTBITE. EYE:MILD (VAPOR)
    IRRITATION, SEVERE (LIQUID) IRRI TATION.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:ANEMIA, ASTHMA, DERMAL SENSITIVITY
    AND LOW BLOOD PRESSURE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH WITH WATER FOR 15 MIN, INCLUDING UNDER EYELIDS.
    GET MEDICAL HELP.  SKIN: FLUSH WITH WATER. TREAT FOR FROSTBITE IF
    NECESSARY BY BATHING AREA WITH LUKEWARM WATER. GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION.	INH ALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. KEEP AT REST. RESTORE
    AND/OR SUPPORT BREATHING AS NEEDED. GET PROMPT MEDICAL ATTENTION. 
    INGESTION: INGESTION IS NOT CONSIDERED A POTENTIAL ROUTE OF
    EXPOSURE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:CARBON DIOXIDE, DRY CHEMICAL OR FOAM. WATER MAY BE
    USED TO COOL CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO THE FIRE TO REDUCE PRESSURE
    BUILDUP.
Fire Fighting Procedures:NONE PROVIDED BY MFR.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CYLINDERS ARE UNDER PRESSURE AND MAY
    RUPTURE UNDER FIRE CONDITIONS. DECOMPOSITION MAY PRODUCT
    HYDROCHLORIC AND HYDROFLUORIC ACID. EXPOSURE TO HEAT OR PROLONGED
    EXPOSURE TO SUN MAY CAUSE BURSTING.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA, ESPECIALLY LOW PLACES WHERE
    HEAVY VAPORS MAY COLLECT. REMOVE OPEN FLAMES. ISOLATE HAZARD UNTIL
    ALL HAS HAS DISPERSED. WATER SPRAY MAY BE USED TO REDUCE VAPORS.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A CLEAN, COOL, VENTILATED
    AREA AWAY FROM SOURCES OF IGNITION AND OXIDIZING AGENTS. MAINTAIN
    TEMPERATURES AT LESS THAN 120F. STORE AS A LEVEL 1 AEROSOL (NFPA
    30B). OVER HEATING, PRESSURIZING,  OR RUSTING CAN CAUSE CAN TO
    BURST RESULTING IN SERIOUS PERSONAL INJURY.
