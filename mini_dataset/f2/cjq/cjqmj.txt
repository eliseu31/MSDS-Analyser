=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES-FLUSH EYES WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR 15 MIN, OCCASIONALLY
    LIFTING THE UPPER & LOWER LIDS. GET MEDICAL AID IMMEDIATELY.
    SKIN-FLUSH SKIN WITH PLENTY OF SOAP AND WATER FOR 15 MIN WHILE
    REMOVING CONTA MINATED CLOTHING & SHOES. GET MEDICAL AID IF
    IRRITATION DEVELOPS OR PERSISTS. INGESTION-DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING.
    IF VICTIM IS CONSCIOUS & ALERT, GIVE 2-4 CUPFULS OF MILK OR WATER.
    NEVER GIVE ANYTHING B Y MOUTH TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. GET MEDICAL
    AID IMMEDIATELY. INHALATION-GET MEDICAL AID IMMEDIATELY. REMOVE
    FROM EXPOSURE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE
    ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF	BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:=4.4C, 40.F
Autoignition Temp:=480.C, 896.F
Lower Limits:1.1
Upper Limits:7.1
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER TO COOL FIRE-EXPOSED CONTAINERS. WATER
    MAY BE INEFFECTIVE. DO NOT USE STRAIGHT STREAMS OF WATER. USE DRY
    CHEMICAL, CARBON DIOXIDE, WATER SPRAY OR REGULAR FOAM.
Fire Fighting Procedures:CONTAINERS CAN BUILD UP PRESSURE IS EXPOSED TO
    HEAT/FIRE. WEAR A SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPRATUS IN
    PRESSURE-DEMAND, MSHA/NIOSH, & FULL PROTECITVE GEAR. DIKE & COLLECT
    WATER USED TO FIGHT FIRE. FLAM MABLE LIQUID. FOR LARGE FIRES, USE
    WATERSPRAY, FOG, OR REGULAR FOAM.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS MAY FORM AN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE WITH
    AIR. VAPORS CAN TRAVEL TO A SOURCE OF IGNITION AND FLASH BACK.
    WATER SPRAY TO COOL FIRE-EXPOSED CONTAINERS. WATER MAY BE
    INEFFECTIVE. DO NOT USE STRAIGHT STRE AMS OF WATER.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:AVOID RUNOFF INTO STORM SEWERS & DITCHES WHICH
    LEAD TO WATERWAYS. REMOVE ALLS OURCES OF IGNITION. ABSORB SPILL
    USING AN ABSORBENT, NON-COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL SUCH AS EARTH, SNAD,
    OR VERMICULITE. A VAPOR  SUPPRESSING FOAM MAY BE USED TO
    REDUCEVAPORS. WATER SPRAY MAY REDUCE VAPOR BUT MAY NOT PREVENT
    IGNITION IN CLOSED SPACES.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARKS, AND
    FLAME. KEEP AWAY FROM SOURCES OF IGNITION. STORE IN A TIGHTLY
    CLOSED CONTAINER. STORE IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED AREA AWAY
    FROM INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. KEEP CONT AINER TIGHTLY CLOSED.
Other Precautions:GROUND & BOND CONTAINERS WHEN TRANSFERRING MATERIAL. 
    EMPTY CONTAINERS RETAIN PRODUCT RESIDUES & CAN BE DANGEROUS. AVOID
    HEAT, SPARKS AND FLAMES. DO NOT PRESSURIZE, CUT, WELD, BRAZE,
    SOLDER, DRILL, GR IND, OR EXPOSE EMPTY CONTAINERS TO HEAT,SPARKS OR
    OPEN FLAMES.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:FOLLOW THE OSHA RESPIRATOR REGULATIONS FOUND IN
    29CFR 1910.134 OR EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 149. ALWAYS USE A NIOSH OR
    EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 149 APPROVED RESPIRATOR WHEN NECESSARY.
Protective Gloves:WEAR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE GLOVES TO PREVENT SKIN
    EXPOSURE.
Eye Protection:EYEGLASSES OR CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES.
Other Protective Equipment:WEAR APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE CLOTHING TO
    PREVENT SKIN EXPOSURE.
