=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:=6.C, 42.8F
Autoignition Temp:=524.C, 975.2F
Lower Limits:4.4%
Upper Limits:16.0%
Extinguishing Media:SM FIRES:USE DRY CHEM, CO*2, WATER
    SPRAY/ALCOHOL-RESIST FOAM. USE WATER SPRAY TO COOL FIRE-EXPOS
    CNTNRS. WATER MAY BE INEFFECTIVE. DO NOT USE STRAIGHT STREAMS OF
    WATER. LG (SUPDAT)
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . NFPA RATING: HEALTH-2; FLAMMABILITY-3; REACTIVITY-0.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CNTNRS CAN BUILD UP PRESS IF EXPOS TO
    HEAT &/OR FIRE. VAPS MAY FORM EXPLO MIX W/AIR. VAPS CAN TRAVEL TO
    IGNIT SOURCE & FLASH BACK. COMBUST GENERATES TOX FUMES. USE WATER

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:USE PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
    AVOID RUNOFF INTO STORM SEWERS AND DITCHES WHICH LEAD TO WATERWAYS.
    REMOVE ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION. ABSORB SPILL USING AN ABSORBENT,
    NON-COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL  SUCH AS EARTH, SAND OR VERMICULITE. A
    VAPOR SUPPRESSING FOAM MAY BE USED TO REDUCE VAPORS. WATER SPRAY
    MAY REDUCE VAPOR BUT MAY NOT PREVENT IGNITION IN CLOSED SPACES.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPKS & FLAME.
    KEEP AWAY FROM SOURCES OF IGNIT. STORE IN TIGHTLY CLOSED CNTNR.
    KEEP FROM CNTCT W/OXIDIZING MATLS. STORE IN COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTD
    AREA AWAY FROM INCOMPAT SUBSTANCES.  WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER HNDLG.
    REMOVE CONTAM CLTHG & WASH BEFORE USE. USE ONLY IN WELL VENTD AREA.
Other Precautions:GROUND & BOND CNTNRS WHEN TRANSFERRING MATL. AVOID
    CNTCT W/EYES, SKIN & CLTHG. EMPTY CNTNRS RETAIN PROD RESIDUE (LIQ
    &/OR VAP) & CAN BE DANGEROUS. KEEP CNTNR TIGHTLY CLSD. AVOID CNTCT
    W/HEAT, SPKS & F LAME. DO NOT INGEST/INHALE. DO NOT PRESSURIZE,
