Effects of Overexposure:SYMPTOMS INCLUDES SLEEPING DIFFICULTIES,
    DECREASED SEX DRIVE AND HEADACHES PROGRESSING TO DECRASED ABILITY
    TO PERFORM SKILLED MOVEMENTS, SPEAKING DIFFICULTIES, EMOTIONAL
    OUTBREAKS, IRRITABILITY, HALLU CINATIONS AND PARKINSONIAN-LIKE
    TREMORS AND FACIAL TICS. REPEATED OR PROLONGED EXPOSURE MAY GREATLY

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE: SPEED IS ESSENTIAL. IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF
    WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. GET MEDICAL HELP. SKIN: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH
    WITH PLENTY OF WATER. REMOVE  CONTAMINATED CLOTHING AND SHOES. WASH
    CLOTHING B EFORE REUSE. DESTROY CONTAMINATED SHOES. INGEST: DO NOT
    INDUCE VOMITING. GIVE WATER TO DRINK. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH
    TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. INHALE: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT
    BREATHING, GIVE  ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT,
    GIVE OXYGEN. GET MEDICAL HELP.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONFLAMMABLE
Extinguishing Media:USE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA APPROPRIATE TO SURROUNDING
    FIRE CONDITIONS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS AND OTHERS WHO MAY BE EXPOSED TO
    PRODUCTS OF COMBUSTION SHOULD WEAR FULL FIRE FIGHTING TURN OUT
    GEAR(FULL BUNKER GEAR) & SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING
    APPARATUS(PRESSURE DEMAND NIOSH APPROVED  OR EQUIVALENT). FIRE
    FIGHTING EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE THOROUGHLY DECONTAMINATED AFTER USE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CONTACT WITH METAL CAN FORM HYDROGEN GAS.
    HYDROGEN IS EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE AND CAN FORM EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES
    WITH AIR. OXIDIZING MATERIAL. FORMS EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES WITH
    COMBUSTIBLE, ORGANIC OR OTHER EASI LY OXIDIZABLE MATERIALS. THESE
    MIXTURES ARE EASILY IGNITED BY FRICTION OR HEAT.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SHOVEL DRY SPILL INTO DOT-APPROVED DRUMS FOR
    DISPOSAL. KEEP SPILL DRY UNTIL AS POSSIBLE HAS BEEN SWEPT UP AND
    SHOVELED INTO DISPOSAL DRUMS. DISSOLVE RESIDUAL AMOUNTS IN WATER
    AND COLLECT SOLUTION IN D OT-APPROVED DRUMS FOR DISPOSAL.DO NOT
    ALLOW PRODUCT OR RINSE WATER FROM SPILL TO ENTER SEWER OR WATERWAY.
Neutralizing Agent:N/P.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT BREATHE DUST. DO NOT GET IN
    EYES, ON SKIN OR CLOTHING. WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER HANDLING. DO NOT
    ENTER CONFINED SPACES UNLESS ADEQUATELY VENTILATED. TO AVOID RAPID
    TEMPERATURE RISE, VIOLENT SPATTE RING, OR EXPLOSIVE ERUPTIONS,
    ALWAYS ADD CAUSTIC TO WATER WHEN MIXING. NEVER ADD WATER TO A
    CAUSTIC.
Other Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY PLACE. AVOID EXCESSIVE HEAT.
