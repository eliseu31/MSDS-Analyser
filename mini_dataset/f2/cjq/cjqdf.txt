    WITH SOAP AND WATER. INHALATION: REMOVE FROM EXPOSURE. INGESTION:
    DILUTE STOMACH CONTENTS WITH SEVERAL GLASSES OF MILK OR WATER.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:WATER, DRY CHEMICAL, CARBON DIOXIDE OR FOAM.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . AVOID INHALATION OF SMOKE.

    0.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SWEEP UP OR VACUUM SPILLED TONER & CAREFULLY
    TRANSFER INTO SEALABLE WASTE CNTNR. SWEEP SLOWLY TO MINIMIZE
    GENERATION OF DUST DURING CLEAN UP. IF VACUUM IS USED, THE MOTOR
    MUST BE RATED AS DUST TIGHT.  A CONDUCTIVE HOSE BONDED TO MACHINE
    SHOULD BE USED TO REDUCE STATIC BUILDUP. RESIDUE CAN BE REMOVED
    W/SOAP & WATER. GARMENTS MAY BE WASHED OR DRY-CLEANED AFTER REMOVAL
    OF LOOSE TONER.

    CALUCLATED 1 HR EXPOS) NON-POISONOUS, DOT. EYE IRRIT:
    NON-IRRITATING. SKIN SENSITIZER: NOT SENSITIZER . SKIN IRRIT: NOT
    IRRITANT. HUMAN PATCH: NON-IRRIT, NON-SENSITIZING. MUTAGENICITY: NO
    MUTAGENICITY DETECTED IN AMES ASSAY. CARCINS: NONE PRESENT. 
    AQUATIC LC50: NOT TESTED. TLV: 10 MG/M3 (TDUST). PEL:  15 MG/M3
    (TDUST); (OTHER INFO)

=====================  Ecological Information  =====================

Ecological:N/P. OTHER INFO: IN THE LUNGS FOR A PRLNGD PERIOD. THIS
    STUDY WAS CONDUCTED USING A SPECIAL TEST TONER TO COMPLY W/EPA
    TESTING PROTOCOL. TEST TONER WAS TEN TIMES MORE RESPIRABLE THAN
    COMMERCIALLY AVAI L XEROX TONER & WOULD NOT BE FUNCTIONALLY
    SUITABLE FOR XEROX EQUIP.
