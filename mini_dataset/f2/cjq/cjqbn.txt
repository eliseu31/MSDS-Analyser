=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Autoignition Temp:=611.C, 1131.8F
Extinguishing Media:WATER SPRAY, DRY CHEMICAL, ALCOHOL FOAM OR CARBON
    DIOXIDE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:AS W/MOST ORGANIC SOLIDS, FIRE IS
    POSSIBLE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES OR BY CONTACT W/AN IGNITION
    SOURCE. LISTED FIRE DATA IS FOR THE ANHYDROUS MATERIAL. FINE DUST
    DISPERSED IN AIR IN SUFFICIENT CONCENT RATIONS, AND IN THE PRESENCE
    OF AN IGNITION SOURCE IS A POTENTIAL DUST EXPLOSION HAZARD.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:REMOVE ALL SOURCES OF IGNIT. VENT AREA OF LEAK
    OR SPILL. WEAR APPROP PERSONAL PROT  EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN EXPOS
    CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROT. SPILLS: CLEAN UP SPILLS IN MANNER THAT DOES
    NOT DISPERSE DUST IN TO AIR. USE NON-SPKG TOOLS & EQUIP. REDUCE
    AIRBORNE DUST & PVNT SCATTERING BY MOISTENING W/WATER. PICK UP
    SPILL FOR RECOVERY OR DISPOSAL & PLACE IN CLOSED CNTNR. SMALL
    AMOUNTS OF RESIDUE (SUPDAT)

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN A TIGHTLY CLOSED CONTAINER,
    STORED IN A COOL, DRY, VENTILATED AREA. PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL
    DAMAGE. ISOLATE FROM ANY SOURCE OF HEAT OR IGNITION.
Other Precautions:CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN
    EMPTY SINCE THEY RETAIN PRODUCT RESIDUES (DUST, SOLIDS); OBSERVE
    ALL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS LISTED FOR THE PRODUCT.
