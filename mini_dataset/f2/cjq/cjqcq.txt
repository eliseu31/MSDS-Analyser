LD50 LC50 Mixture:SEE TOXICOLOGICAL FIELD.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:NO	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: VAPOR IS HEAVIER THAN AIR
    AND CAN CAUSE SUFFOCATION BY REDUCING OXYGEN AVAILABLE FOR
    BREATHING. BREATHING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF VAPOR MAY LEAD TO
    NARCOSIS, CARDIAC IRREGULARITIES, UNCONSC IOUSNESS OR DEATH.
    METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS METABOLIZED TO CO, RAISING THE CARBOXY
    HEMOGLOBIN CONCENTRATION IN THE BLOOD WITH RESULTING SYMPTOMS OF
    CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING. SKIN: METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS  CLASSIFIED
    AS AN IRRITANT.SKIN PERMEATION CAN OCCUR IN AMOUNTS CAPABLE OF
    PRODUCING THE EFFECTS OF SYSTEMIC TOXICITY. EYE: LIQUID CONTACT CAN
    CAUSE DISCOMFORT, USUALLY NO EXTENDED EFFECTS. ORAL: INGES TION OF
    FREON TMC IS TO BE AVOIDED.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS LISTED AS POSSIBLE
    CARCINOGEN BY NTP. BASED ON ANIMAL STUDIES & HUMAN EXPERIENCE THIS
    MIXTURE POSES NO HAZARD TO MAN RELATIVE TO SYSTEMIC TOXICITY,
    CARCINOGENICITY, MUTAGENICITY  OR TERATOGENICITY. WHEN EXPOSURES
    ARE BELOW RECOMMENDED TLV.	CALIFORNIA'S PROPOSITION 65 LISTS
    METHYLENE CHLORIDE AS CHEMICAL KNOWN TO  STATE TO CAUSE CANCER.
Effects of Overexposure:INHALATION: SUDDOCATION, LIGHT-HEADEDNESS,
    GIDDINESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, NARCOSIS, UNCONSCIOUSNESS, DEATH,
    SYMPTOMS OF CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING SKIN: IRRITATION, SYSTEMIC
    TOXICITY. EYES: DISCOMFORT . ORAL TOXICITY IS LOW.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: MOVE TO FRESH AIR, CALL A PHYSICIAN. IF NOT
    BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION, PREFERABLY MOUTH-TO-MOUTH.
    IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT GIVE OXYGEN. DO NOT GIVE EPINEPHRINE OR
    SIMILIAR DR UGS. EYE: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTYOF WATER FOR 15
    MIN. CALL A PHYSICIAN. SKIN: FLUSH WITH WATER. GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION IF IRRITATION IS PRESENT. ORAL: CALL A PHYSICIAN. DO NOT
    INDUCE VOMITING. GI VE TWO GLASSES OF WATER OR ACTIVATED CHARCOAL
    SLURRY (50G ACTIVATED CHARCOAL IN 400ML WATER). NEVER GIVE ANYTHING
    BY MOUTH TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON.

Extinguishing Media:NON-FLAMMABLE
Fire Fighting Procedures:SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS(SCBA) MAY
    BE REQUIRED IF AEROSOLS RUPTURE AND CONTENTS ARE SPILLED UNDER FIRE
    CONDITIONS.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:PRESSURIZED AEROSOL CONTAINERS AT
    ELEVATED TEMPERATURES MAY VENT, RUPTURE,OR BURST AND ADD TO FLYING
    AND FALLING DEBRIS. DECOMPOSITION MAY OCCUR.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA. REMOVE OPEN FLAMES OR RED HOT
    SURFACES. ALLOW TO EVAPORATE. IF SPILL IS LARGE, COLLECT ON
    ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND TRANSFER TO STEEL DRUMS FOR RECOVERY OR
    DISPOSAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE NEAR SOURCES OF HEAT, IN
    DIRECT SUNLIGHT OR WHERE TEMPERATURE EXCEEDS 120F. DO NOT PUNCTURE
    OR DAMAGE CONTAINERS. ROTATE STOCK TO SHELF LIFE OF ONE YEAR.
Other Precautions:NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE INCREASED RISK
    OF ELICITING CARDIAC DYSRYTHMIAS. CATECHOLAMINE DRUGS, SUCH AS
    EPINEPHRINE, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED ONLY AS A LAST RESORT IN LIFE
    THREATENING EMERGEN CIES.
