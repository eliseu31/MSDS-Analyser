=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: DUST MAY BE SLIGHTLY
    IRRITATING. SORE THROAT OR COUGHING MAY OCCUR. INGESTION: SINCE
    MAGNESIUM SALTS ARE SLOWLY ABSORBED, ABDOMINAL PAIN, VOMITING AND
    DIARRHEA MAY BE THE ONLY SYMPTOMS. HO WEVER, IF ELIMINATION IS
    BLOCKED BY BOWEL BLOCKAGE OR OTHER REASONS, CNS DEPRESSION, LACK OF
    REFLEXES, HYPOCALCEMIA (DEFICIENCY OF CALCIUM IN THE BLOOD) MAY
    OCCUR. SKIN CONTACT: NO ADVERSE EFFECTS EXP ECTED BUT MAY CAUSE
    MINOR SKIN IRRITATION. EYE CONTACT: NO ADVERSE EFFECTS EXPECTED BUT
    DUST MAY CAUSE MECHANICAL IRRITATION. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: NO
    INFORMATION FOUND.
Effects of Overexposure:SEE HEALTH HAZARDS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NO INFORMATION FOUND.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. GET MED ATTN FOR ANY BREATHING
    DIFFICULTY. INGEST: GIVE SEVERAL GLASSES OF WATER TO DRINK TO
    DILUTE. IF LARGE AMOUNTS WERE SWALLOWED, GET MED ADVICE. SKIN
    CONTACT: REMOVE A NY CONTAM CLTHG. WASH SKIN W/SOAP & WATER FOR AT
    LEAST 15 MINUTES. GET MED ATTN IF IRRITATION DEVELOPS OR PERSISTS.
    EYE CONTACT: WASH THOROUGHLY W/RUNNING WATER FOR AT LEAST 15
    MINUTES. GET MED ADVICE  IF IRRITATION DEVELOPS. NOTE TO MD: IV
    ADMINISTRATION OF CALCIUM GLUCONATE WILL PARTIALLY REVERSE EFFECTS
    OF ACUTE MAGNESIIUM TOXICITY. VENTRICULAR SUPPORT W/CALCIUM
    CHLORIDE INFUSION & MANNITOL FORC ED DIURESIS HAS ALSO BEEN
    SUCCESSFUL.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:USE ANY MEANS SUITABLE FOR EXTINGUISHING
    SURROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NOT CONSIDERED TO BE A FIRE HAZARD. NOT
    CONSIDERED TO BE AN EXPLOSION HAZARD.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA OF LEAK OR SPILL. WEAR
    APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AS SPECIFIED IN EXPOSURE
    CONTROLS/PERSONAL PROTECTION. SPILLS: SWEEP UP AND CONTAINERIZE FOR
    RECLAMATION OR DISPOSAL. VA CUUMING OR WET SWEEPING MAY BE USED TO
    AVOID DUST DISPERSAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN A TIGHTLY CLOSED CONTAINER,
    STORED IN A COOL, DRY, VENTD AREA. PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
    ISOLATE FROM INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. CONTAINERS OF THIS MATL MAY
    BE HAZARDOUS WHEN EMPTY SINCE  THEY RETAIN PROD RESIDUES (DUST,
    SOLIDS); OBSERVE ALL WARNINGS AND PRECAUTIONS LISTED FOR THE PROD.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:PERSONAL RESPS (NIOSH APPRVD): FOR CNDTNS OF USE
    WHERE EXPOSURE TO DUST OR MIST IS APPARENT, A HALF-FACE DUST/MIST
    RESP MAY BE WORN. FOR EMERGENCIES OR INSTANCES WHERE THE EXPOSURE
    LEVELS ARE NOT KNOW N, USE A FULL-FACE POSITIVE-PRESSURE,
    AIR-SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR. WARNING: AIR-PURIFYING RESPS DO NOT
    PROTECT WORKERS IN OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES.
Ventilation:A SYSTEM OF LOCAL &/OR GENERAL EXHAUST IS RECOM TO KEEP
    EMPLOYEE EXPOSURES AS LOW AS POSS. LOCAL EXHAUST VENT IS GENERALLY
    PREFERRED BECAUSE IT CAN (SUPDAT)
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
Eye Protection:ANSI APPROVED CHEMICAL WORKERS GOGGLES .
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH AND DELUGE SHOWER MEETING ANSI
    DESIGN CRITERIA . WEAR CLEAN BODY-COVERING CLOTHING.
Supplemental Safety and Health
VENT: CONTROL EMISSIONS OF CONTAMINANT AT ITS SOURCE, PREVENTING
    DISPERION OF IT INTO THE GENERAL WORK AREA. PLEASE REFER TO ACGIH
    DOCUMENT, INDUSTRIAL VENTILATION, A MANUAL OF RECOMMENDED
    PRACTICES,	MOST RECENT EDITION, FOR DETAILS. AIRBORNE EXPOSURE
    LIMITS: NONE ESTABLISHED.
