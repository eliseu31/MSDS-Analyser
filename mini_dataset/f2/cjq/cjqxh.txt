===================  Toxicological Information	===================

Toxicological Information:TONER PRESENTS A LOW HAZARD FOR USUAL
    OCCUPATIONAL SETTINGS. BASED ON AVAILABLE DATA, HUMAN EXPOSURE TO
    TONER HAS BEEN SHOWN TO CAUSE MINIMAL RESPIRATORY TRACT IRRITATION
    AS MAY OCCUR WITH LARGE AMOUN TS OF ANY NON-TOXIC DUSTS. THE
    RESULTS OF ONE ANIMAL STUDY WHERE RATS INHALED TONER THAT WAS TEN
    TIMES MORE RESPIRABLE THAN COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE TONER WERE
    OBSERVED TO HAVE NO LUNG CHANGES AT LOW EX POSURES (THE MOST
    RELEVANT LEVEL TO POTENTIAL HUMAN EXPOSURES). AT HIGHER LEVELS A
    SLIGHT DEGREE OF LUNG FIBROSIS WAS OBSERVED DUE TO EXCESSIVE
    AMOUNTS OF DUST RETAINED IN LUNGS FOR A PROLONGED INTERV AL.
