=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: EYES: CONTACT W/LIQUID MAY
    RESULT IN IRRITATION, REDNESS, TEARING, AND BLURRED VISION. SKIN:
    CONTACT W/WET MATERIAL MAY RESULT IN IRRITATION OF SKIN, POSSIBLE
    DERMATITIS, AND POSSIBLE DEFATTING	OF SKIN. INHALATION: INHALATION
    OF AIRBORNE CRYSTALLINE SILICA GENERATED FROM MECHANICAL BUFFING
    MAY CAUSE SILICOSIS AND IS A SUSPECTED CARCINOGEN. SWALLOWING:
    INGESTION OF THIS MATERIAL MAY CAUSE GA STROINTESTINAL IRRITATION,
    NAUSEA, DIARRHEA, AND VOMITING. ASPIRATION OF MATERIAL INTO THE
    LUNGS DUE TO VOMITING MAY PRODUCE CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS WHICH CAN BE
    FATAL. CHRONIC: CRYSTALLINE SILICA (EFTS  OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:SILICA, CRYSTALLINE-CRISTOBALITE: IARC
    MONO, SUPP. VOL 7, PG 341, 1987: GROUP 1. NTP 8TH ANNUAL RPT ON
    CARCINS, 1998: REAS ANTIC TO BE HUMAN CARCIN.  IARC HAS CLASSIFIED
    CRYSTALLINE SILICA AS GRP 1A C ARCIN (PROBABLY CARCIN TO HUMANS).
    CLASSIFICATION IS BASED ON LMTD HUMAN EVID, & SUFFICIENT EVID IN
    EXPER ANIMALS. CRYSTALLINE SILICA IS CHEM KNOWN TO (SUPDAT)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZS: IS CONSIDERED TO BE HAZARDOUS BY
    INHALATION, AND IS SUSPECTED HUMAN CARCINOGEN. CRYSTALLINE SILICA
    MAY ALSO PRODUCE SILICOSIS WHICH IS A NON-CANCEROUS LUNG DISEASE.
    REPORTS HAVE ASSOCIATED  REPEATED AND PROLONGED OVEREXPOSURE TO
    SOLVENTS WITH NEUROLOGICAL AND OTHER PHYSIOLOGICAL DAMAGE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH IMMEDIATELY W/LARGE AMTS OF WATER FOR AT LST 15
    MINUTES. SEE PHYSICIAN FOR MEDICAL TREATMENT. SKIN: IMMEDIATELY
    WASH AFFECTED AREA W/SOAP & WATER. REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING.
    CONSULT PHY SICIAN IF IRRITATION DEVELOPS. INHAL: REMOVE PERSON TO
    FRESH AIR. RESTORE BREATHING. KEEP PERSON WARM AND QUIET. TREAT
    SYMPTOMATICALLY. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. SWALLOWED: KEEP PERSON WARM
    AND QUIET. CO NSULT PHYSICIAN OR POISON CONTROL CENTER IMMEDIATELY.
