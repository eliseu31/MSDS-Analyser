Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: INHALATION: MAY CAUSE
    IRRITATION TO THE RESPIRATORY TRACT. SYMPTOMS MAY INCLUDE COUGHING
    AND SHORTNESS OF BREATH. INGESTION: PHOSPHATES ARE SLOWLY AND
    INCOMPLETELY ABSORBED WHEN INGESTED, AND S ELDOM RESULT IN SYSTEMIC
    EFFECTS. SUCH EFFECTS, HOWEVER, HAVE OCCURRED. SYMPTOMS MAY INCLUDE
    VOMITING, LETHARGY, DIARRHEA, BLOOD CHEMISTRY EFFECTS, HEART
    DISTURBANCES AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECT S. THE TOXICITY OF
    PHOSPHATES IS BECAUSE OF THEIR ABILITY TO SEQUESTER CALCIUM. SKIN
    CONTACT: IRRITANT DUE TO ITS ACIDIC NATURE. MAY CAUSE INFLAMMATION
    AND PAIN ON PROLONGED CONTACT, ESPECIALLY WITH M OIST SKIN. (EFTS
    OF OVEREXP)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: EYE CONTACT: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION,
    REDNESS AND PAIN. CHRONIC: MAY SEQUESTER CALCIUM AND CAUSE CALCIUM
    PHOSPHATE DEPOSITS IN THE KIDNEYS. J.T.BAKER SAF-T-DATA RATINGS
    HEALTH RATING: 1-SLIGHT.  FLAMMABILITY RATING: 0-NONE. REACTIVITY

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IINHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR
    ANY BREATHING DIFFICULTY. INGESTION: GIVE LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER TO
    DRINK. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. GET
    MEDICA L ATTENTION. SKIN CONTACT: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH SKIN WITH
    PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. REMOVE CONTAMINATED
    CLOTHING AND SHOES. WASH CLOTHING BEFORE REUSE. THOROUGHLY CLEAN
    SHOES BEFORE REUSE.  GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IF IRRITATION DEVELOPS.
    EYE CONTACT: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15
    MINUTES, LIFTING UPPER AND LOWER EYELIDS OCCASIONALLY. GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION IF IRRIT ATION PERSISTS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:USE ANY MEANS SUITABLE FOR EXTINGUISHING
    SURRROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA & FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AN EXPLOSION HAZARD.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA OF LEAK OR SPILL. WEAR
    APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AS SPECIFIED IN SECTION
    8. SPILL: SWEEP UP AND CONTAINERIZE FOR RECLAMATION OR DISPOSAL.
    VACUUMING OR WET SWEEPING MAY B E USED TO AVOID DUST DISPERSAL.
    SMALL AMOUNTS OF RESIDUE MAY BE FLUSHED TO SEWER WITH PLENTY OF
    WATER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN A TIGHTLY CLOSED CONTAINER,
    STORED IN A COOL, DRY, VENTILATED AREA. PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL
    DAMAGE. CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN EMPTY
    SINCE THEY RETAIN PRODUCT RESIDUES	(DUST, SOLIDS); OBSERVE ALL

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:FOR CONDITIONS OF USE WHERE EXPOSURE TO THE DUST
    OR MIST IS APPARENT, A NIOSH APPROVED HALF-FACE DUST/MIST
    RESPIRATOR MAY BE WORN. FOR EMERGENCIES/INSTANCES WHERE EXPOSURE
    LEVELS ARE NOT KNOWN, USE A  NIOSH APPROVED FULL-FACE
    POSITIVE-PRESSURE, AIR-SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR. WARNING: AIR-PURIFYING
    RESPIRATORS DO NOT PROTECT WORKERS IN OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES.
Ventilation:SYS OF LOCAL &/GENL EXHST IS REC TO KEEP EMPLOYEE EXPOS AS
    LOW AS POSS. LOC EXHST VENT IS GENERALLY PREFERRED BECAUSE IT CAN
    CONTROL EMISSIONS (SUPDAT)
