=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:LOW TOXICITY & NOT CONSIDERED TO BE
    HAZARDOUS TO HEALTH. INHALATION: DUST MAY IRRITATE MUCOUS MEMBRANES
    OR UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT.  EYES: MECHANICAL INJURY OR PARTICLE
    MAY EMBED IN EYE. VIEWING OF BU RNING MAGNESIUM POWDER WITHOUT FIRE
    GLASSES MAY RESULT IN "WELDER'S FLASH", DUE TO INTENSE WHITE FLAME.
     SKIN: EMBEDDING OF PARTICLE IN SKIN.  INGESTION: UNLIKELY;
    HOWEVER, INGESTION OF LARGE AMOUNTS  OF MAGNESIUM POWDER COULD
    CAUSE INJURY.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:MAGNESIOUM IS NOT SUSPECTED OF BEING
    CARCINOGENIC.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.  EYES: FLUSH EYES WITH WATER
    THOROUGHLY. CONSULT A PHYSICIAN.  SKIN: WASH WITH SOAP & WATER
    THOROUGHLY TO REMOVE PARTICLES.  INGESTION: IF LARGE AMOUNTS OF
    MAGNESIUM P OWDER ARE INGESTED, INDUCE VOMITING & CONSULT A
    PHYSICIAN.	NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: NO SPECIFIC TREATMENT OR ANTIDOTE.
    SUPPORTIVE CARE RECOMMENDED. TREATMENT SHOULD BE BASED ON REACTIONS
    OF THE PATIENT.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NA
Autoignition Temp:<650.C, 1202.F
Extinguishing Media:SMOTHER BURNING MAGNESIUM POWDER BY GENTLY COVERING
    WITH DRY AGENTS ONLY SUCH AS MELTING FLUX, DRY SAND, DRY TALC,
    MET-L-X POWDER, PRUPLE-K POWDER, G1 OR OTHER SUITABLE AGENTS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:BURNING MAGNESIUM PRODUCES VERY BRIGHT WHITE
    FLAME. APPLY EXTINGUISHING AGENTS CAREFULLY TO AVOID DISTURBING OR
    SPREADING THE BURNING MAGNESIUM POWDER. APPLY AGENTS TO SMOTHER
    BURNING MAGNESIUM POWDER . MONITOR CAREFULLY FOR FLARE-UPS. USE
    SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS (SCBA) OR APPROACH FIRE FROM
    UPWIND.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:MAGNESIUM POWDER BURNS VIGOROUSLY ONCE IT
    IS IGNITED. MAGNESIUM POWDER CAN EXPLODE IF SUSPENDED IN THE AIR. 
    WATER WILL ACT AS AN ACCELERANT, INTENSIFYING THE FIRE & POSSIBLY
    RESULTING IN "POPPING" OR  FLARE-UP, SPREADING THE FIRE AND
    ENDANGERING PERSONNEL. DO NOT USE WATER!

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SHOULD BE PROMPTLY SWEPT UP USING NATURAL
    FIBER BRUSHES OR BROOMS AND A NON-SPARKING DUST PAN. THE POWDER
    SWEEPINGS MUST BE KEPT SEPARATE FROM OTHER TRASH & REFUSE. IF
    POWDER IS DRY, PLACE IT IN A COV ERED STEEL DRUM. IF POSSIBLE,
    REUSE. WET MAGNESIUM POWDER WILL OXIDIZE, GENERATING HEAT &
    HYDROGEN GAS. SUCH WET POWDER MAY AUTOIGNITE. USE EXTREME CARE.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A DRY AREA, SEPARATED FROM
    OTHER COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS. POWDER MUST BE KEPT DRY & AWAY FROM
    SOURCES OF HEAT OR IGNITION. STORE TIGHTLY SEALED IN STEEL DRUMS.
    EXPOSURE TO AIR & HUMIDITY SHOULD  BE AVOIDED. THERE SHOULD BE NO
    AUTOMATIC FIRE SPRINKLERS NEAR LARGE AMOUNTS OF MAGNESIUM.
Other Precautions:NO SMOKING IN ANY AREA WHERE MAGNESIUM POWDER IS
    STORED.  CARE IN HANDLING SHOULD BE USED TO AVOID DUST SUSPENSIONS.
     MELTING OF MAGNESIUM POWDER IS EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS & SHOULD NOT BE
    ATTEMPTED.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE AN APPROVED DUST MASK OR RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:EITHER EXTREME CARE IN HANDLING OR A VENTILATION SYSTEM
    (EXPLOSION PROOF) IS NECESSARY TO PREVENT ANY AIRBORNE DUST
    CONCENTRATIONS.
Protective Gloves:RECOMMENDED.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES OR GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:FLAME RESISTANT CLOTHING WITHOUT CUFFS OR
    POCKETS  RECOMMENDED. AVOID WEARING FABRICS WHICH CAUSE STATIC
    SPARKS (I.E. WOOL, SOME SYNTHETICS).
Work Hygienic Practices:ACCUMULATIONS OF MAGNESIUM POWDERS OR DUST MUST
    BE PREVENTED. THOROUGH CLEANUP, INCLUDING BUILDING RAFTERS AND
    LEDGES MUST BE DONE FREQUENTLY IF DUST IS PRESENT.
Supplemental Safety and Health
SWEEP SPILLS UP PROMPTLY. WORK AREAS MUST BE KEPT CLEAN AT ALL TIMES.
