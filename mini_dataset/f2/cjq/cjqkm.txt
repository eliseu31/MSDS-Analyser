=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. TREAT SYMPTOMATICALLY. IF SYMPS
    ARE PRESENT GET MED ATTN. SKIN:IMMED FLUSH W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR @
    LST 15 MINS. GET MED ATTN IF SYMPS ARE PRESENT AFTER WASHING,
    EYES:IMMED F LUSH W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LST 15 MINS & GET MED
    ATTN. INGEST:CALL MD IMMED . NOTE TO MD:ABSORPTION OF THIS PROD
    INTO BODY LEADS TO FORM OF METHEMOGLOBIN WHICH, IN SUFFICIENT CONC
    CAUSES CYAN OSIS. SINCE REVERSION OF METHEMOGLOBIN TO HEMOGLOBIN
    OCCURS SPONT AFTER TERMINATION OF EXPOS, MOD DEGREES OF CYANOSIS
    NEED TO BE TREATED ONLY BY SUPPORTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS BED REST &
    OXYG INHAL. THRO RO CLEANSING OF ENTIRE CONTAM(SUPP DATA)
