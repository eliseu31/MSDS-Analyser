=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:LONG TERM STUDIES WITH EXPERIMENTAL
    ANIMALS HAVE SHOWN THAT DIAZINON IS NOT ONCONGENIC OR CARCINOGENIC,
    NOR DOES IT AFFECT REPRODUCTIVE CAPABILITIES OF RATS OVER 2
    GENERATIONS. IT IS NOT TERATOGENIC I N RATS OR RABBITS, AND DOES
    NOT CAUSE DELAYED NEUROTOXICITY. IT IS ALSO NOT MUTAGENIC. NO LONG
    TERM EFFECTS, OTHER THAN SYMPTOMS ASSOCIATED WITH ANTI-CHOLINERGIC
    ACTIVITY AT HIGH DOSE LEVELS, OCCURED  IN ANY OF STUDIES CONDUCTED
    WITH DIAZINON.
Effects of Overexposure:DIAZINON IS A CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITOR.
    SYMPTOMS OF CHOLINESTERASE INHIBITION CAN INCLUDE HEADACHE,
    DIZZINESS, BLURRED VISION, WEAKNESS, NAUSEA, CRAMPS, DIARRHEA,
    DISCOMFORT IN CHEST, NERVOUSNESS, SWE ATING, MIOSIS (PINPOINT
    PUPILS), TEARING, SALIVATION, PULMONARY EDEMA, UNCONTROLLABLE
    MUSCLE TWITCHES, CONVULSIONS, COMA & LOSS OF REFLEXES & SPHINCTER
