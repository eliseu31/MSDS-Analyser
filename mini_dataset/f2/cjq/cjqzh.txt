=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:FOR CONDITIONS OF USE WHERE EXPOSURE TO DUST OR
    MIST IS APPARENT, A NIOSH APPROVED HALF-FACE DUST/MIST RESPIRATOR
    MAY BE WORN. FOR EMERGENCIES OR INSTANCES WHERE EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE
    NOT KNOWN, USE A N IOSH APPROVED FULL-FACE POSITIVE-PRESSURE,
    AIR-SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR. WARNING: AIR-PURIFYING RESPIRATORS DO NOT
    PROTECT WORKERS IN OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES.
Ventilation:SYS OF LOC &/OR GEN EXHST IS REC TO KEEP EMPLOYEE EXPOS AS
    LOW AS POSS. LOC EXHST VENT IS GENRLY PREF BECAUSE IT CAN CONTROL
    EMISSIONS OF CONTAM AT ITS (SUPDAT)
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES.
