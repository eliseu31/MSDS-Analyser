=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:NO  Ingestion:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE AND CHRONIC: APPROXIMATE LETHAL
    CONCENTRATION OF HALON 1301 TO THE RAT IS 80% FOR 15 MINUTES. HALON
    1301 HAS ANESTHETIC AND CARDIAC EFFECTS IN HUMANS AT CONCENTRATIONS
    BELOW 10% ARE CONSIDERED S AFE FOR 0-5 MINUTES EXPOSURES. HALON
    1301 IS CLASSIFIED AS GROUP 6 (LEAST TOXIC) IN THE UNDERWRITERS
    LABORATORIES CLASSIFICATION OF COMPARATIVE LIFE HAZARDS OF FIRE
    EXTINGUISHING AGENTS.
Effects of Overexposure:ANESTHETIC EFFECT OF HALON 1301 AT LEVELS BELOW
    10% IS SIMILAR TO A FEELING OF MILD INTOXICATION. ANESTHETIC
    EFFECTS TO CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE 10% (15-20), MAY LEAD TO
    UNCONSCIOUSNESS, POSSIBLY DEATH. H UMAN HEALTH EFFECTS OF
    OVEREXPOSURE BY INHALATION MAY INCLUDE NONSPECIFIC DISCOMFORT, SUCH
    AS NAUSEA, HEADACHE, WEAKNESS; OR TEMPORARY CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM
    DEPRESSION WITH EFFECTS SUCH AS DIZZINESS,	HEADACHE, CONFUSION,
    INCOORDINATION, AND LOSS OF CONSCIOUSNESS. HIGHER EXPOSURE MAY
    CAUSE TEMPORARY ALTERATION OF HEART'S ELECTRICAL ACTIVITY WITH
    IRREGULAR PULSE OR INADEQUATE CIRCULATION. SKIN/EYE  CONTACT WITH
    LIQUID MAY CAUSE FROSTBITE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:INDIVIDUALS WITH PRE-EXISTING
    DISEASES OF THE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM OR CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM MAY
    HAVE INCREASED SUSCEPTIBILITY TO THE TOXICITY OF EXCESSIVE
    EXPOSURES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE VICTIM TO FRESH AIR. GIVE SYMPTOMATIC AND
    SUPPORTIVE CARE. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. NOTE: ADRENALIN IS
    CONTRADICTED IN TREATMENT OF OVEREXPOSURE TO HALON 1301. SKIN
    CONTACT: IN CASE O F CONTACT, FLUSH SKIN WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR
    15 MINUTES. TREAT FOR FROSTBITE IF NECESSARY BY GENTLY WARMING
    AFFECTED AREA. EYE CONTACT: IN CASE OF CONTACT, IMMEDIATELY FLUSH
    EYES WITH PLENTY OF WATE R FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. CALL A
    PHYSICIAN. NOTES TO PHYSICIAN: BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE DISTURBANCES OF
    CARDIAC RHYTHM, CATECHOLAMINE DRUGS SUCH AS EPINEPHRINE SHOULD ONLY
    BE USED WITH SPECIAL CAUTION IN  SITUATIONS OF EMERGENCY LIFE
    SUPPORT.
