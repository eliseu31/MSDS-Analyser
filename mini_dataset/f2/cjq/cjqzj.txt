Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:THE MAJOR HAZ OF PHENOL IS ITS ABILITY
    TO PENETRATE SKIN RAPIDLY, PARTICULARLY WHEN LIQ, CAUSING SEV
    INJURY WHICH CAN BE FATAL. PHENOL ALSO HAS STRONG CORR EFT ON BODY
    TISS CAUSING SEV CHEM BURNS. DUE  TO ITS LOC ANESTH PROPERTIES,
    SKIN BURNS MAY BE PAINLESS. INHAL: BRTHG VAP, DUST/MIST RSLTS IN
    DIGESTIVE DISTURBS (VOMIT, DFCLTY IN SWALLOWING, DIARR, LOSS OF
    APPETITE). WILL IRRITATE, POSS BURN RESP  TRACT. OTHER SYMPS LISTED
    UNDER INGEST MAY OCCUR. INGEST: POIS. SYMPS MAY INCL BURNING PAIN
    IN MOUTH & THROAT, ABDOM PAIN, NAUS, VOMIT, HDCH, DIZZ, MUSC WEAK,
    CNS EFTS, INCR IN HEART RATE, IRREG BRTH G, COMA & POSS DEATH.
    (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:PHENOL (CAS # 108-95-2): IARC CATEGORY
    3.
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: ACUTE EXPOS IS ALSO ASSOC W/KIDNEY &
    LIVER DMG. INGEST OF 1 GRAM HAS BEEN LETHAL TO HUMANS. SKIN: CORR.
    RAPIDLY ABSORBED THRU SKIN W/SYSTEMIC POISONING EFTS TO FOLLOW.
    DISCOLORATION & SEV BU RNS MAY OCCUR, BUT MAY BE DISGUISED BY LOSS

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IN CASE OF PHENOL POIS, START FIRST AID TREATMENT IMMED, THEN
    GET MED ATTN. PEOPLE ADMINISTERING FIRST AID SHOULD TAKE PRECS TO
    AVOID CONT W/PHENOL. A PHENOL ANTIDOTE KIT (CASTOR OIL/OTHER
    VEGETABLE O IL, POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 300) SHOULD BE AVAIL IN ANY
    PHENOL WORK AREA. ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE OF PHENOL POIS SHOULD
    BE PLANNED & PRACTICED BEFORE BEGINNING WORK W/PHENOL. CASTOR OIL
    &/OR POLYETHYL ENE GLYCOL CAN BE GIVEN BY FIRST RESPONDER BEFORE
    MED HELP ARRIVES. INHAL: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BRTHG, GIVE
    ARTF RESP. IF BRTHG IS DFCLT, GIVE OXYGEN. GET MED ATTN IMMED.
