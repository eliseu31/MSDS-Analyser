=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:NO	Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EXTENSIVE STUDIES HAVE BEEN CONDUCTED
    ON HALOCARBON OILS SIMILAR TO THE ONES FOUND IN THIS PRODUCT. BASED
    ON ALL THE AVAILABLE DATA IN THREE SPECIES OF ANIMALS, LIMITED
    EXPOSURE TO THIS PRODUCT SHOULD  NOT BE HARMFUL TO ANY PORTION OF
    THE HUMAN ANATOMY. STUDIES CONDUCTED BY THE AIR FORCE HAVE
    DEMONSTRATED LIVER TOXICITY IN RODENTS BUT NOT IN PRIMATES. THE
    OBSERVED LIVER TOXICITY IS BELIEVED TO BE S PECIFIC FOR RODENTS AND
    NOT RELEVENT TO HUMANS. HALOCARBON OILS ARE NOT IRRITATING TO THE
    SKIN BUT SIMPLE SKIN PROTECTION SHOULD BE USED TO PREVENT REPEATED
    EXPOSURE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SENSITIZATI ON.  (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: ALL MUTAGANIC STUDIES WERE NEGATIVE.
    AMORPHOUS SILICA, UNLIKE CRYSTALLINE SILICA, IS CONSIDERED
    BIOLOGICALLY BENIGN. SINCE THE POTENTIAL FOR HUMAN TOXICITY CANNOT
    BE RULED OUT PROPER WORK PR ACTICES SHOULD BE EMPLOYED. ACUTE:
    FROMTHE ANIMAL STUDIES, SIGNS OF FLUORIDE POISONING MAY BE
    EXPECTED. THESE INCLUDE NAUSEA, SHORTNESS OF BREATH AND LOSS OF
    APPETITE. CHRONIC: UNKNOWN.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE KNOWN.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================
