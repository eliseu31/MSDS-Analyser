=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: HIGH LEVEL OF SULFURIC
    ACID VAPORS/MIST MAY CAUSE SEVERE RESPIRATORY IRRITATION. SKIN
    CONTACT: SULFURIC ACID MAY CAUSE SEVERE IRRITATION, BURNS AND
    ULCERATION. NOT READILY ABSORBED THROUGH  SKIN. EYE CONTACT:
    SULFURIC ACID VAPORS/MIST CAN CAUSE SEVERE IRRITATION, BURNS,
    CORNEA DAMAGE AND POSSIBLE BLINDNESS. LEAD MAY CAUSE IRRITATION.
    INGESTION: SULFURIC ACID MAY CAUSE SEVERE IRRITATION  OF MOUTH,
    THROAT, ESOPHAGUS AND STOMACH. LEAD COMPOUNDS MAY CAUSE ABDOMINAL
    PAIN, NAUSEA, HEADACHES, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, SEVERE CRAMPING.
    INGESTION SHOULD BE TREATED BY PHYSICIAN.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:LEAD HAS BEEN TESTED FOR ABILITY TO
    CAUSE CANCER. THE RESULTS SHOWED THAT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
    EVIDENCE TO SHOW THAT LEAD CAN OR CANNOT CAUSE CANCER.
Effects of Overexposure:ACUTE EFFECTS: SULFURIC ACID MAY CAUSE SEVERE
    SKIN IRRITATION, BURNS, DAMAGE TO CORNEA AND POSSIBLE BLINDNESS AND
    UPPER RESPIRATORY IRRITATION. LEAD COMPOUNDS MAY CAUSE ABDOMINAL
    PAIN, NAUSEA, HEADACH ES, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, SEVERE CRAMPING AND
    DIFFICULTY IN BREATHING. CHRONIC EFFECTS: SULFURIC ACID MAY LEAD TO
    SCARRING OF CORNEA, INFLAMMATION OF NOSE, THROAT AND BRONCHIAL
    TUBES AND POSSIBLE EROSIO N OF TOOTH ENAMEL. LEAD COMPOUNDS MAY
    CAUSE ANEMIA, DAMAGE TO KIDNEYS AND NERVOUS SYSTEM. MAY CAUSE
    REPRODUCTIVE CHANGES IN BOTH MALES AND FEMALES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: SULFURIC ACID: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY.
    IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. LEAD COMPOUNDS: REMOVE FROM
    EXPOSURE, GARGLE, WASH NOSE AND LIPS. CONSULT PHYSICIAN. SKIN:
    SULFURIC  ACID: FLUSH WITH WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. REMOVE
    CONTAMINATED CLOTHING AND SHOES. LEAD COMPOUNDS ARE NOT ABSORBED
    THROUGH THE SKIN. EYES: SULFURIC ACID AND LEAD COMPOUNDS: FLUSH
    IMMEDIATELY WITH  WATER FOR AT LEAST15 MINUTES, THEN CONSULT
    PHYSICIAN.	INGESTION: SULFURIC ACID: GIVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF
    WATER - DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING - THEN CONSULT A PHYSICIAN.. LEAD
    COMPOUNDS: CONSULT A PHYSICI AN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:4.65 (H2)
Upper Limits:93.9
Extinguishing Media:CO2,FOAM,DRY CHEMICAL
Fire Fighting Procedures:IF BATTERIES ON CHARGE,TURN OFF POWER.USE
    POSITIVE PRESSURE,SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS.WATER APPLIED
    TO ELECTROLYTE GENERATES HEAT AND CAUSES IT TO SPLATTER.WEAR ACID
    RESISTANT CLOTHING.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN GASES ARE PRODUCED
    DURING NORMAL BATTERY OPERATION OR WHEN ON CHARGE(HYDROGEN IS
    HIGHLY FLAMMABLE AND OXYGEN SUPPORTS COMBUSTION).THESE GASES ENTER
    THE AIR THROUGH THE VENT CAPS. T O AVOID RISK OF EXPLOSION,KEEP
    SPARKS AND OTHER SOURCES OF IGNITION AWAY FROM BATTERY.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:REMOVE COMBUSTIBLES AND SOURCES OF IGNITION.
    STOP FLOW AND CONTAIN SPILL BY DIKING WITH SODA ASH (SODIUM
    CARBONATE) OR QUICK LIME (CALCIUM OXIDE). CAREFULLY NEUTRALIZE
    SPILL WITH SODA ASH, ETC. COLLEC T RESIDUE AND PLACE IN A DRUM WITH
    A LABEL SPECIFYING "CONTAINS HAZARDOUS WASTE". IF BATTERY IS
    LEAKING, PLACE IT IN A HEAVY DUTY PLASTIC BAG. WEAR PROPER
    EQUIPMENTS. DO NOT RELEASE UNNEUTRALIZED ACID
Neutralizing Agent:SODA ASH (SODIUM CARBONATE), QUICK LIME (CALCIUM
    OXIDE)

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE REQUIRED UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS. IF
    CONCENTRATIONS OF SULFURIC ACID MIST ARE KNOWN TO EXCEED PEL,USE
    NIOSH OR OSHA APPROVED RESPIRATORY PROTECTION.
Protective Gloves:RUBBER OR PLASTIC ACID RESISTANT GLOVES WITH ELBOW
    LENGTH GAUNTLET.
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SPLASH GOGGLES OR FACE SHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:ACID RESISTANT APRON.UNDER SEVERE EXPOSURE
    OR EMERGENCY CONDITIONS, WEAR ACID RESISTANT CLOTHING AND BOOTS.
Work Hygienic Practices:MAKE CERTAIN VENT CAPS ARE ON TIGHTLY. PLACE
    MINIMUM OF 2 LAYERS OF CARBOARD BETWEEN LAYERS OF BATTERIES. DO NOT
    STACK MORE THAN 3 LAYERS HIGH.
Supplemental Safety and Health
DO NOT ALLOW METALLIC MATERIALS TO SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTACT  BOTH THE
    POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE TERMINALS OF THE BATTERIES. USE BATTERY
    CARRIER TO LIFT A BATTERY OR PLACE HANDS ON OPPOSITE CORNERS TO
    AVOID  SPILLING ACID THROUGH THE VENTS. AVOID CONTACT WITH INTERNAL
    COMPONENTS OF THE BATTERY.
