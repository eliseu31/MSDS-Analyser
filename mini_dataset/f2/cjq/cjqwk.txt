Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:TARGET ORGANS: EYE, SKIN, CNS,
    RESPIRATORY AND GI TRACTS (HMIS). ACUTE - EYE: CAN CAUSE
    IRRITATION. SPLASHES MAY CAUSE PAIN AND BLURRED VISION. SKIN:
    CAUSES IRRITATION, CRACKING OR FLAKING DUE TO DEFA TTING.
    INHALATION: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION TO MUCOUS MEMBRANES OF UPPER
    RESPIRATORY TRACT. PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO HIGH CONCENTRATIONS MAY
    CAUSE DROWSINESS, LOSS OF APPETITE AND INABILITY TO CONCENTRATE. I
    NGESTION: CAUSE HEADACHES, GASTRITIS, INTOXICATION, BLINDNESS AND,
    IN ACUTE CASES, DEATH. CHRONIC - SKIN DRYNESS. MAY AFFECT NERVOUS
    SYSTEM, LIVER, BLOOD REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. CONTINUED INGESTION OF SM
    ALL AMOUNTS COULD RESULT IN BLINDNESS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:ETHANOL HAS BEEN LINKED TO CANCER IN
    HUMANS. CHRONIC ETHANOL INGESTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH LIVER CANCER.
    MOST INDUSTRIAL ETHANOL CONTAINS DENATURANTS THAT RENDER IT

    SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF THIS PRODUCT.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE
    ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN.
    CALL A PHYSICIAN. INGESTION: INDUCE VOMITING IMMEDIATELY AS
    DIRECTED BY MEDICAL  PERSONNEL. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTHTO AN
    UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. SKIN CONTACT: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA OF SPILL.  REMOVE ALL SOURCES
    OF IGNITION. WEAR APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
    ISOLATE HAZARD AREA. CONTAIN AND RECOVER LIQUID WHEN POSSIBLE. USE
    NON-SPARKING TOOLS. COLLECT  LIQUID IN AN  APPROPRAITE CONTAINER OR
    ABSORB WITH AN INERT  MATERIAL (E.G., VERMICULITE, DRY SAND), AND
    PLACE IN A CHEMICAL WASTE CONTAINER. DO NOT USE COMBUSTIBLE
    MATERIALS. DO NOT FLUSH TO SEWERS

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED
    LOCATION, AWAY FROM FIRE HAZARD AREA. OUTSIDE OR DETACHED STORAGE
    IS PREFERRED. SEPARATE FROM INCOMPATIBLES. CONTAINERS SHOULD BE
    BONDED AND GROUNDED FOR TRANSFER S TO AVOID STATIC SPARKS.	STORAGE
    AND USE AREA SHOULD BE NO SMOKING AREAS.
Other Precautions:PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE. USE NON-SPARKING
    TYPE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING EXPLOSION PROOF VENTILATION.
    CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HZARDOUS WHEN EMPTY SINCE THEY
    RETAIN PRODUCT RESI DUES (VAPORS, LIQUID); OBSERVE ALL WARNINGS AND
    PRECAUTIONS LISTED FOR THE PRODUCT.
