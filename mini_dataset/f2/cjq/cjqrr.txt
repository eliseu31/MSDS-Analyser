=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHAL: CAUSES IRRITATION TO THE
    RESPIRATORY TRACT. SYMPTOMS MAY INCLUDE COUGHING, SHORTNESS OF
    BREATH. INHAL OF MIST OR VAPOR MAY PRODUCE ASPIRATION PNEUMONIA.
    INGEST: MATERIAL IS CATHARTIC AND CAN CA USE SERIOUS DIARRHEA.
    NAUSEA AND VOMITING MAY ALSO OCCUR AND POSSIBLY ABDOMINAL 
    CRAMPING. ASPIRATION OF MINERAL OIL INTO LUNGS CAN CAUSE CHEMICAL
    PNEUMONIA. SKIN CONTACT: PRLNGD CONTACT MAY CAUSE IRR ITATION;
    OCCASIONALLY DERMATITIS DUE TO HYPERSENSITIVITY OCCURS. EYE
    CONTACT: MIST OR FUMES CAN IRRITATE EYES. CAN CAUSE DISCOMFORT
    SIMILAR TO MOTOR OIL. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: PRLNGD/RPTD SKIN EXPOSURE
    MA Y CAUSE (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZS: DERMATITIS. HIGHLY REFINED MINERAL
    OILS ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS HUMAN CARCINOGENS. HOWEVER, RELATED
    FORMS (UNTREATED AND MILDLY-TREATED OILS) ARE LISTED AS HUMAN
    CARCINOGENS BY BOTH NTP AND I ARC.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING SKIN
    DISORDERS OR IMPAIRED RESPIRATORY FUNCTION MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE
    TO THE EFFECTS OF THE SUBSTANCE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================
