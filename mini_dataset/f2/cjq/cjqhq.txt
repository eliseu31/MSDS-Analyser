=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: EYES: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION.
    SKIN CONTACT:MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC DERMATITIS, PAPULAR FORMATION,
    ULCERS, DRY AND SCALY SKIN, FEVER. SKIN ABSORPTION: NO EVIDENCE OF
    ADVERSE EFFECTS. INHALATION: MAY CA USE RESPIRATORY TRACT
    IRRITATION, WITH CHEST PAIN, VOMITNG, DIARRHEA, BURNING SENSATION,
    AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION. MAY ALSO CAUSE INTERSTITIAL
    PNEUMONITIS AND SENSITIZATION OF THE RESPIRA TORY TRACT. INGESTION:
    MAY CAUSE NAUSEA, ABDOMINAL PAIN, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION, AND BURNING SENSATION. CHRONIC: EYES:
    DAMAGE. SKIN: AFFECT WHOLE BODY WITH LESIONS, SORE NESS, ITCHING.
    INHALATION: EMPHYSEMA.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NICKEL HAS BEEN DETERMINED TO CAUSE
    CANCER IN EXPERMENTAL ANIMALS (IARC, NTP). NICKEL IS LISTED AS A
    PROBABLE HUMAN CARCINOGEN.

    PAIN, VOMITING, DIARRHEA, CENTRAL NERVOUS SY STEM DEPRESSION,
    BURNING SENSATION.CHRONIC ECZEMA/NEURODERMATIS FROM NICKEL DOES
    REQUIRE CONTINUOUS METAL CONTACT.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:BREATHING OF DUST MAY AGGRAVATE
    ASTHMA AND INFLAMMATORY OR FIBROTIC PULMONARY DISEASE. MAY ALSO
    AGGRAVATE AN EXISTING DERMATITIS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH WITH PENTY OF WATER. IF DISCOMFORT PERSISTS, GET
    MEDICAL ATTENTION, PREFERABLY AN OPTALMOLOGIST. SKIN: WASH
    THOROUGHLY WITH SOAP AND WATER. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.
    GIVE ARTIFICIAL  RESPIRATION  IF NOT BREATHING. OXYGEN MAY BE GIVEN
    IF NECESSARY. CALL A PHYSICIAN. INGESTION: GIVE AT LEAST 2 GLASSES
    OF MILK OR WATER. INDUCE VOMITING, UNLESS PATIENT IS UNCONSCIOUS.
    CALL A PHYSICIA N. NOTES TO PHYSICIAN: THE HAZARDS OF THIS MATERIAL
    ARE MAINLY DUE TO ITS SENSITIZING AND MILD IRRITATING PROPERTIES.
    THERE IS NO SPECIFIC ANTIDOTE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Upper Limits:O.OO%
Extinguishing Media:USE DRY POWDER METAL EXTINGUISHING MATERIAL TO
    EXTINGUISH METAL FIRES. USE APPROPRIATE EXTINGUISHER TO EXTINGUISH 
    MATERIALS THAT MAY BE IGNITED BY THE THERMAL SPRAY FLAME.
Fire Fighting Procedures:COMPLY WITH ANSI Z49.1 SAFETY IN WELDING AND
    CUTTING, NFPA51B STANDARD FOR FIRE PREVENTION IN USE OF CUTTING AND
    WELDING PROCESSES. NFPA51 OXYGEN-FUEL GAS SYSTEMS FOR WELDING AND
    CUTTING, AND NFPA58 S TANDARD FOR THE STORAGE AND HANDLING
    OFLIQUIDIFIED PETROLEUM GASES.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:AIRBORNE DUST PARTICLES, ESPECIALLY METAL
    DUST, AND ACCUMULATION OF SUCH SHOULD BE TREATED AS EXPLOSIVES. TO
    MINIMIZE DANGER FROM DUST EXPLOSIONS, ADEQUATE VENTILATION SHOULD
    BE PROVIDED TO SPARY BOOT H IN ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN WELDING
    SOCIETY PUBLICATION AWSC2.1-73, AND ACGIH PUBLICATION "INDUSTRIAL
    VENTILATION".

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO PROTECT AGAINST
    HAZARDS AND DISPOSE OF PER WASTE DISPOSAL METHOD.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:CAUTION: WHEN THERMAL SPRAYING;
    ELECTRICITY CAN CAUSE FATAL SHOCK. ARC RAYS CAN BURN EYES AND SKIN.
    WEAR RECOMMENDED EYE AND BODY PROTECTION. FUMES, GAS, AND DUST CAN
    HARM YOUR HEALTH. PROVIDE ENOUGH  VENTILATION AND WEAR RESPIRATOR.
Other Precautions:ALWAYS SPRAY WITH ENOUGH VENTILATION. SPARKS DURING
    SPRAYING CAN BE A SOURCE OF IGNITION OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS.
    PREVENT FIRES. REFER TO NFPA 51B "CUTTING AND WELDING PROCESSES".

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:DEPENDS UPON SPECIFIC USE, CONDITION, AND
