Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: INHALATION: NO ADVERSE EFFECTS
    EXPECTED. MAY CAUSE MILD IRRITATION TO THE RESPIRATORY TRACT.
    INGESTION: NO ADVERSE EFFECTS EXPECTED. MAY CAUSE MILD IRRITATION
    TO THE GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT. SKI N: NOT EXPECTED TO BE A HEALTH
    HAZARD FROM SKIN EXPOSURE. MAY CAUSE MILD IRRITATION AND REDNESS.

    POSSIBLE REDDENING. CHRONIC: PROLONGED IN HALATION OF EXCESSIVE
    DUST MAY PRODUCE PULMONARY DISORDERS.
Effects of Overexposure:SEE HEALTH HAZARDS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NO INFORMATION FOUND.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR
    ANY BREATHING DIFFICULTY. INGESTION: GIVE SEVERAL GLASSES OF WATER
    TO DRINK TO DILUTE. IF LARGE AMOUNTS WERE SWALLOWED, GET MEDICAL
    ADVICE. S KIN: NOT EXPECTED TO REQUIRE FIRST AID MEASURES. WASH
    EXPOSED AREA WITH SOAP AND WATER. GET MEDICAL ADVICE IF IRRITATION
    DEVELOPS. EYES: WASH THOROUGHLY WITH RUNNING WATER FOR AT LEAST 15
    MINUTES. GET  MEDICAL ADVICE IF IRRITATION DEVELOPS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:WATER OR WATER SPRAY.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:AS WITH MOST ORGANIC SOLIDS, FIRE IS
    POSSIBLE AT ELEVATED TEMPERATURES OR BY CONTACT WITH AN IGNITION
    SOURCE. FINE DUST DISPERSED IN AIR IN SUFFICIENT CONCENTRATIONS,
    AND IN THE PRESENCE OF AN IGNITIO N SOURCE IS A POTENTIAL DUST
    EXPLOSION HAZARD. MINIMUM EXPLOSIBLE CONCENTRATION 0.140 G/L.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:REMOVE ALL SOURCES OF IGNIT. VENT AREA. WEAR
    APPROP PERS PROT EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN CTL MEASURES SECTION. CLEAN
    UP SPILLS IN A MANNER THAT DOES NOT DISPERSE DUST INTO AIR. USE
    NON-SPKG TOOLS & EQUIP.  REDUCE AIRBORNE DUST & PVNT SCATTERING BY
    MOISTENING W/WATER. PICK UP SPILL FOR RECOVERY/DISP & PLACE IN CLSD
    CONTR. WARNING! SPENT PROD MAY HAVE ABSORBED HAZ MATLS.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:PROTECT AGAINST PHYSICAL DAMAGE. STORE
    IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED LOCATION, AWAY FROM ANY AREA WHERE
    THE FIRE HAZARD MAY BE ACUTE. OUTSIDE OR DETACHED STORAGE IS
    PREFERRED. SEPARATE FROM INCOMPAT IBLES. CONTAINERS SHOULD BE
    BONDED AND GROUNDED FOR TRANSFERS TO AVOID STATIC SPARKS.
Other Precautions:STORAGE AND USE AREAS SHOULD BE NO SMOKING AREAS. USE
    NON-SPARKING TYPE TOOLS AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING EXPLOSION-PROOF
    VENTILATION. CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN

    RESPIRATOR MAY BE WORN. FOR EMERGENCIES/INSTANCES WHERE THE
    EXPOSURE LEVELS ARE NOT KNOWN, USE A  NIOSH APPROVED FULL-FACE
    POSITIVE-PRESSURE, AIR-SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR. WARNING: AIR-PURIFYING
    RESPIRATORS DO NOT PROTECT WORKERS IN OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES.
Ventilation:A SYS OF LOC &/OR GEN EXHST IS REC TO KEEP EMPLOYEE EXPOS
    BELOW AIRBORNE EXPOS LIMS. LOC EXHST VENT IS GEN PREF BECAUSE IT
    CAN CTL EMISSIONS OF (SUP DAT)
Protective Gloves:WEAR IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
