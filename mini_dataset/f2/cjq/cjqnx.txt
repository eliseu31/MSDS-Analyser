=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE: FLUSH W/H*2O FOR AT LEAST 15 MIN. GET MED ATTN. SKIN:
    REMOVE CONTAMD CLTHG & SHOES. WASH AFFECTED AREA(S) THOROUGHLY
    W/SOAP & H*2O. IF IRRIT PERSIST, SEEK MED ATTN. INHAL: REMOVE TO
    FRESH AIR. IF  NOT BRTHG, GIVE ARTF RESP. IF BRTHG IS DIFFICULT,

    SWALLOWED. DO NOT INDUCE VOMIT. GIVE VICTIM GLASS OF WATER OR MILK.
    CALL MD/POIS CTL  CTR IMMED. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO UNCON
    PERS. SHOULD VOMITING OCCUR, BE SURE TO KEEP VICTIM'S HEAD BELOW
    HIPS TO AVOID ASPIRATION OF VOMITUS INTO LUNGS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:PMCC
Flash Point:=22.2C, 72.F
Lower Limits:1.2%
