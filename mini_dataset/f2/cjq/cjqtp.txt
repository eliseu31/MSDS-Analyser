Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:TARGET ORGANS: LIVER, KIDNEYS, LUNGS.
    POTENTIAL HEALTH EFFECTS: EYE: CAN CAUSE EYE IRRITATION, STINGING,
    TEARING, REDNESS AND SWELLING. SKIN: CAN CAUSE IRRITATION.
    PROLONGED OR REPEATED CONTACT MAY CA USE REDNESS, BURNING, DRYING
    AND CRACKING OF SKIN. CAN BE ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN. SWALLOWING:
    SWALLOWING SMALL AMOUNTS DURING NORMAL HANDLING IS NOT LIKLEY TO
    CAUSE HARMFUL EFFECTS. SWALLOWING LARGE AM OUNTS MAY BE HARMFUL.
    THIS MATERIAL CAN GET INTO LUNGS RESULTING IN LUNG INFLAMMATION AND
    OTHER LUNG INJURY. INHALATION: BREATHING OF VAPOR OR MIST IS
    POSSIBLE AND MAY BE HARMFUL. SYMPTOMS USUALLY OCC UR AT
    CONCENTRATIONS ABOVE PEL.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:METHYLENE CHLORIDE HAS BEEN SHOWN TO
    CAUSE LIVER AND LUNG CANCER IN LABORATORY MICE. IT IS LISTED AS
    CARCINOGEN BY IARC AND NTP.
Effects of Overexposure:STOMACH OR INTESTINAL UPSET (NAUSEA, VOMITING,
    DIARRHEA) IRRITATION (NOSE, THROAT, AIRWAYS), CENTRAL NERVOUS
    SYSTEM DEPRESSION (DIZZINESS, DROWSINESS, WEAKNESS, FATIGUE,
    NAUSEA, HEADACHE, UNCONSCIOUSN ESS) AND OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS
    SYSTEM EFFECTS, LOW BLOOD PRESSURE, MILD, TEMPORARY CHANGES IN THE
    LIVER, EFFECTS ON HEART RATE, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION (SLOWING OF
    THE BREATHING RATE), LOSS OF COORDINA TION, CONFUSION, IRREGULAR
    HEARTBEAT, ELEVATED CARBON MONOXIDE LEVEL IN THE BLOOD, LUNG EDEMA
    (FLUID BUILDUP IN THE LUNG TISSUE), KIDNEY DAMAGE, COMA, AND DEATH.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PREEXISTING DISORDERS OFTHE
    FOLLOWING ORGANS: SKIN, LUNG (FOR EXAMPLE, ASTHMA-LIKE CONDITIONS),
    LIVER, KIDNEY, HEART AND DISEASES (CORONARY ARTERY)  IF EXPOSED TO
    HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF THIS MATERIAL.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: MOVE TO FRESH AIR. FLUSH EYES GENTLY WITH WATER FOR AT
    LEAST 15 MINUTES WHILE HOLDING EYELIDS APART. SEEK IMMEDIATE
    MEDICAL ATTENTION. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING. FLUSH
    EXPOSED AREA WITH  LARGE AMOUNT OF WATER. IF SKIN IS DAMAGED OR
    SYMPTOMS PERSISTS, SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. SWALLOWING:
    SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. IF INDIVIDUAL IS DROWSY OR UNCONSCIOUS, DO
    NOT GIVE ANYTHING BY M OUTH, PLACE INDIVIDUAL ON LEFT SIDE WITH
    HEAD DOWN. CONTACT PHYSICIAN FOR ADVICE. INHALATION: MOVE TO FRESH
    AIR. SEEK IMMEDIATE MEDICAL ATTENTION. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE
    ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BRE ATHING IS DIFFICULT, ADMINISTER
    OXYGEN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:ND
Lower Limits:2.0
Extinguishing Media:REGULAR FOAM, WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, DRY
    CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR A SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS WITH
    A FULL FACEPIECE OPERATED IN THE POSITIVE PRESSURE DEMAND MODE WITH
    APPROPRIATE TURN-OUT GEAR AND CHEMICAL RESISTANT PERSONAL
    PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NEVER USE WELDING OR CUTTING TORCH ON OR
    NEAR DRUM(EVEN EMPTY) BECAUSE PRODUCT/RESIDUE CAN IGNITE
    EXPLOSIVELY. NO FLASH POINT. THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS HALOGENATED
    SOLVENTS WHICH INHIBIT FLASHING UNTIL T HE HALOGENATED SOLVENT HAS
    BEEN EVAPORATED AWAY. VAPORS HEAVIER THAN AIR CAN TRAVEL TO
    IGNITION SOURCES AND BE IGNITED.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SMALL SPILL: ABSORB LIQUID ON VERMICULITE.
    LARGE SPILL: ELIMINATE ALL IGNITION SOURCES. STOP SPILL AT SOURCE.
    PREVENT FROM ENTERING DRAINS, SEWERS, STREAMS OR OTHER BODIES OF
    WATER. PREVENT FROM SPREA DING. IF RUNOFF OCCURS, NOTIFY
    AUTHORITIES AS REQUIRED. PUMP OR VACUUM TRANSFER SPILLED PRODUCT TO
    CLEAN CONTAINERS FOR RECOVERY. ABSORB UNRECOVERABLE PRODUCT.
    TRANSFER TO CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:ALUMINUM EQUIPMENT SHOULD NOT BE USED
    FOR STORAGE AND/OR TRANSFER. CONTACT WITH ALUMINUM PARTS IN A
    PRESSURIZABLE FLUID SYSTEM MAY CAUSE VIOLENT REACTIONS.
Other Precautions:CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN
    EMPTIED. SINCE EMPTIED CONTAINERS RETAIN PRODUCT RESIDUES (VAPORS,
    LIQUID, AND/OR SOLID). ALL HAZARD PRECAUTIONS GIVEN IN THE DATA
    SHEET MUST BE OBSER VED.
