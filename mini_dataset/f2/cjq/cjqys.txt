Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:MAJOR HAZ OF PHENOL IS ITS ABILITY TO
    PENETRATE SKIN RAPIDLY, PARTICULARLY WHEN LIQ, CAUSING SEV INJURY
    WHICH CAN BE FATAL. PHENOL ALSO HAS STRONG CORROSIVE EFT ON BODY
    TISS CAUSING SEV CHEM BURNS. DU E TO ITS LOCAL ANESTHETIZING
    PROPERTIES, SKIN BURNS MAY BE PAINLESS. INHAL: BRTHG VAP, DUST OR
    MIST RSLTS IN DIGESTIVE DISTURBS (VOMIT, DFCLTY IN SWALLOWING,
    DIARR, LOSS OF APPETITE). WILL IRRIT, POSS IBLY BURN RESP TRACT.
    OTHER SYMPS LISTED UNDER INGEST MAY ALSO OCCUR. INGEST: POISON.
    SYMPS MAY INCL BURNING PAIN IN MOUTH & THROAT, ABDOMINAL PAIN,
    NAUS, VOMIT, HDCH, DIZZ, MUSC WEAK, CNS EFTS, INCR	IN HEART RATE,
    (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH EFTS: IRREGULAR BRTHG, COMA & POSS DEATH.
    ACUTE EXPOS IS ALSO ASSOCIATED W/KIDNEY & LIVER DMG. INGESTION OF 1
    GRAM HAS BEEN LETHAL TO HUMANS. SKIN CNTCT: CORROSIVE. RAPIDLY
    ABSORBED THRU SKIN W/S YSTEMIC POISONING EFTS TO FOLLOW.
    DISCOLORATION & SEV BURNS MAY OCCUR, BUT MAY BE DISGUISED BY LOSS
    IN PAIN SENSATION. EYE CNTCT: CORROSIVE. EYE BURNS W/REDNESS, PAIN,
    BLURRED VISION MAY OCCUR. MAY CA USE SEV DMG & BLINDNESS. CHRONIC
    EXPOS: RPTD EXPOS MAY CAUSE SYMPS DESCRIBED FOR ACUTE POISONING AS

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IN CASE OF PHENOL POISONING, START FIRST AID TREATMENT IMMED,
    THEN GET MED ATTN. PEOPLE ADMIN FIRST AID SHOULD TAKE PRECS TO
    AVOID CNTCT W/PHENOL. PHENOL ANTIDOTE KIT (CASTOR OIL/OTHER
    VEGETABLE OIL,  POLYETHYLENE GLYCOL 300) SHOULD BE AVAILIN PHENOL
    WORK AREA. PLAN & PRACTICE ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN IN CASE OF PHENOL
    POIS BEFORE BEGINNING WORK W/PHENOL. CASTOR OIL &/OR POLYETHYLENE
    GLYCOL CAN BE GIVEN  BY FIRST RESPONDER BEFORE MED HELP ARRIVES.
    INHAL:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BRTHG, GIVE ARTF RESP. IF BRTHG
    DFCLT, GIVE OXYG. GET MED ATTN IMMED. INGEST: IMMED ADMIN CASTOR
    OIL/OTHER VEGETABLE OIL.  NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY (SUPDAT)

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:CC

Autoignition Temp:=715.C, 1319.F
Lower Limits:1.3%
Upper Limits:8.6%
Extinguishing Media:WATER SPRAY, DRY CHEM, ALCOHOL FOAM OR CARBON
    DIOXIDE. WATER SPRAY MAY BE USED TO KEEP FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS
    COOL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTER'S PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS
    INEFFECTIVE FOR FIRES INVOLVING THIS MATERIAL. STAY AWAY FROM
    SEALED CONTAINERS.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FIRE: COMBUSTIBLE. CONTACT WITH STRONG
    OXIDIZERS MAY CAUSE FIRE. EXPLOSION: ABOVE FLASH POINT, VAPOR-AIR
    MIXTURES ARE EXPLOSIVE WITHIN FLAMMABLE LIMITS NOTED ABOVE. SEALED
    CONTAINERS MAY RUPTURE WHEN  HEATED.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:REMOVE ALL IGNIT SOURCES. VENT AREA OF
    LEAK/SPILL. WEAR APPROP PPE AS SPECIFIED. CLEAN UP SPILLS IN MANNER
    THAT DOES NOT DISPERSE DUST INTO AIR. USE NON-SPKG TOOLS & EQUIP.
    REDUCE AIRBORNE DUST & PVNT  SCATTERING BY MOISTENING W/WATER. PICK
    UP SPILL FOR RECOVERY/DISP & PLACE IN CLSD CNTNR. DO NOT FLUSH TO
    SEWER. DRY LIME/SODA ASH MAY BE USED ON SPILL FOR NEUT. US REGS
    (CERCLA) REQ (SARA INFO)
Neutralizing Agent:DRY LIME OR SODA ASH MAY BE USED ON SPILL FOR
    NEUTRALIZATION.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN TIGHTLY CLSD CNTNR. STORE IN
