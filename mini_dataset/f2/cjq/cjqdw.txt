=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESTORE & SUPPORT CONTINUED
    BREATHING. GET EMERGENCY MED ATTN. HAVE TRAINED PERSON GIVE OXYGEN
    IF NECESSARY. GET MED HELP FOR ANY BREATHING DIFFICULTY. REMOVE TO
    FRESH AIR  IF INHAL CAUSES EYE WATERING, HEADACHES, DIZZ/OTHER
    DISCOMORT. GET MED ATTN IF DISCOMFORT/IRRIT PERSISTS. SKIN : FLUSH
    W/H*2O. THEN WASH THOROUGHLY W/SOAP & H*2O. REMOVE CONTAMD
    CLOTHING. WASH CONTAMD  CLOTHING BEFORE RE-USE. IF IRRIT OCCURS,
    CONSULT A MD. EYE: FLUSH IMMED W/LARGE AMTS OF H*2O. ESPECIALLY
