Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EXPOSURE MAY BE BY INHAL &/OR SKIN OR
    EYE CONTACT, DEPENDING ON CNDTNS OF USE. TO MINIMIZE EXPOSURE,
    FOLLOW RECOMS FOR PROPER USE, VENT & PERSONAL PROT EQUIP. ACUTE
    HEALTH HAZS: IRRITATION OF EYES, SK IN & RESPIRATORY SYSTEM. MAY
    CAUSE NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION. EXTREME OVEREXP MAY RESULT IN
    UNCON & POSSIBLY DEATH. HEADACHE, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA & LOSS OF COORD
    ARE INDICATIONS OF EXCESSIVE EXPOSURE TO  VAPORS OR SPRAY MISTS.
    REDNESS & ITCHING OR BURNING SENSATION MAY INDICATE EYE OR
    EXCESSIVE SKIN EXPOSURE. CHRONIC: TOLUENE APPEARS ON THE NAVY LIST
    OF OCCUPATIONAL CHEMICAL REPRODUCTIVE HAZS. SEEK C ONSULTATION
    (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZS: FROM APPROPRIATE HEALTH
    PROFESSIONALS CONCERNING LATEST HAZ LIST INFO & SAFE HANDLING &
    EXPOSURE INFO . PRLNGD OVEREXP TO SOLVENT INGREDIENTS LISTED IN
