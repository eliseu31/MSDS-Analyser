=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EYES: MAY CAUSE MILD EYE IRRITATION.
    SKIN: MAY CAUSE MILD SKIN IRRITATION.  SWALLOWING: SWALLOWING SMALL
    AMOUNTS DURING NORMAL HANDLING IS NOT LIKELY TO CAUSE HARMFUL
    EFFECTS. SWALLOWING LARGE AMOUNTS  MAY BE HARMFUL. INHALATION:
    BREATHING SMALL AMOUNTS OF THIS MATERIAL DURING NORMAL HANDLING IS
    NOT LIKELY TO CAUSE HARMFUL EFFECTS. BREATHING LARGE AMOUNTS MAY BE
    AHRMFUL. SYMPTOMS USUALLY OCCUR AT C ONCENTRATION S HIGHER THAN THE
    RECOMMENDED EXPOSURE LIMITS. TARGET ORGANS: LIVER, TESTES, KIDNEYS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NO DATA.
Effects of Overexposure:STOMACH OR INTESTINAL UPSET (NAUSEA, VOMITING,
    DIARRHEA), IRRITATION (NOSE, THROAT, AIRWAYS).
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PRE-EXISTING DISORDERS OF THE
    LIVER, KIDNEYS, TESTES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH  GENTLY WITH WATER FOR AT LEAST 15
    MINUTES, HOLD EYELIDS APART. IF SYMPTOMS DEVELOP, MOVE AWAY FROM
    EXPOSURE. SEEK MEDICAL ATTENTION. SWALLOWING: SEEK MEDICAL
    ATTENTION. IF SLEE PY OR DROWSY, NOTHING BY MOUTH. IF
    CONSCIOU/ALERT, GIVE SYRUP OF IPECAC OR STICK FINGERS DOWN THROAT.
    DO NOT LEAVE PERSON UNATTENDED. SKIN:REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHES.
    WASH EXPOSED AREA WITH SOAP & WA TER. IF SYMPTOMS PERSIST, SEEK
    MEDICAL ATTENTION. LAUNDER CLOTHES BEFORE RESUE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:SCC
Flash Point:=91.7C, 197.F
Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:N/D
Lower Limits:N/D
Upper Limits:N/D
Extinguishing Media:ALCOHOL FOAM, CARBON DIOXIDE, DRY CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE USED TO EXTINGUISH FIRE BY
    COOLING, AND DILUTING LIQUID WITH WATER. WEAR A SELF-CONTAINED
    BREATHING APPARATUS WITH A FULL FACEPIECE OPERATED IN THE POSITIVE
    PRESSURE DEMAND MODE WITH APPR OPRIATE TURN-OUT GEAR AND CHEMICAL
    RESISTANT PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND MAY
    TRAVEL ALONG THE GROUND OR BE MOVED BY VENTILATION AND IGNITED BY
    HEAT, PILOT LIGHTS, OTHER FLAMES AND IGNITION SOURCES AT LOCATIONS
    DISTANT FROM MATERIAL HANDLING  POINT. NEVER USE WELDING, CUTTING
    TORCH ON DRUM(EVEN EMPTY) BECAUSE PRODUCT(EVEN JUST RESIDUE)CAN
    IGNITE EXPLOSIVELY

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ABSORB LIQUID ON VERMICULITE, FLOOR ABSORBENT
    MATERIAL & TRANSFER TO HOOD. LARGE SPILL: ELIMINATE SOURCES OF
    IGNITION. EXCLUDE UN PROTECTED PERSONS FROM SPILL AREA UNTIL
    CLEAN-UP CPMPLETED. STOP SPILL  AT SOURCE. PREVENT FROM SPREADING.
    KEEP OUT OF SEWERS,  WATERWAYS. NOTIFY AUTHORITIES IF RUN-OFF
    OCCURS.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:CONTAINERS MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN
    EMPTY. EMPTIES MAY RETAIN RESIDUE (VAPOR. LIQUID AND/OR SOLID). ALL
    HAZARD PRECAUTIONS MUST BE GIVEN IN THE MSDS MUST BE OBSERVED. ALL
    CONTAINERS SHOULD BE BONDED & GR OUNDED DURING MATERIAL TRANSFERS.
Other Precautions:SUDDEN RELEASE OF HOT ORGANIC VAPORS OR MISTS FROM
    PROCESS EQUIPMENT DURING OPERATIONS INVOLVING ELEVATED TEMPERATURES
    & PRESSURE, MAY RESULT IN IGNITIONS WITHOUT THE PRESENCE OF OBVIOUS
    IGNITION SOUR CES.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF OVEREXPOSURE HAS BEEN DETERMINED/ DOCUMENTED,
    A NIOSH/MSHA JOINTLY APPROVED AIR SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR IS ADVISED IN
    ABSENCE OF PROPER ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROL. OSHA REG-ULATIONS ALSO
    PERMIT OTHER NIOSH/ MSHA RESPIRATORS UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS.
    (SEE  SAFETY EQUIPMENT SUPPLIER.) ENGINEERING OR ADMINISTRATIVE
    CONTROLS SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO REDUCE EXPOSURE.
Ventilation:PROVIDE SUFFICIENT MECHANICAL(GENERAL AND/OR LOCAL EXHAUST)
    VENTILATION TO MAINTAIN EXPOSURE BELOW LEVEL OF OVEREXPOSURE.
Protective Gloves:NITRILE RUBBER
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SPASH GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:IMPERVIOUS CLOTHING AND BOOTS. EMERGENCY EYE
    WASH STATIONS & SAFETY SHOWERS SHOULD BE AVAILABLE IN THE IMMEDIATE
    VICINITY OF POTENTIL EXPOSURE.
Work Hygienic Practices:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Supplemental Safety and Health
NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
