=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMED. IF NOT BRTHG, GIVE ARTF
    RESP. IF BRTHG IS DFCLT, GIVE OXYG. GET MED ATTN. INGEST:DO NOT
    INDUCE VOMIT. IF VICTIM IS CONSCIOUS & ALERT, GIVE WATER. (NEVER
    GIVE ANYTHING  BY MOUTH TO UNCON PERS!) GET MED ATTN IMMED.
    SKIN:FLUSH W/PLENTY OF SOAP & WATER FOR AT LST 15 MINS. REMOVE
    CONTAM CLTHG. SEEK MED ATTN. DESTROY CONTAM SHOES. EYES:FLUSH
    W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LST 1 5 MINS, OCCAS LIFTING UPPER & LOWER
    LIDS. GET MED AID IMMED. DO NOT ALLOW VICTIM TO RUB/KEEP EYES CLSD.
    NOTE TO MD'S:ABSORPTION OF SILVER NITRATE INTO BODY LEADS TO FORM
    OF METHEMOGLOBIN THAT, IN SUFF ICIENT CONCS, CAUSES CYANOSIS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:N/E
Upper Limits:N/E
Extinguishing Media:NONCOMBUSTIBLE. FLOOD WITH WATER ONLY. NO DRY
    CHEMICAL, CARBON DIOXIDE, OR HALON.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . APPLY FROM AS FAR A DISTANCE AS POSSIBLE. REMOVE
    CONTAINER FROM FIRE AREA IF WITHOUT RISK. COOL FIRE-EXPOSED
    CONTAINERS WITH WATER UNTIL W ELL AFTER FIRE IS OUT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OXIDIZER. GREATLY INCREASES THE BURNING
    RATE OF COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS. NFPA RATING: HEALTH - 3; FIRE - 0;
    REACTIVITY - 1.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:DO NOT TOUCH SPILLED MATERIAL. WEAR NIOSH
    APPROVED DUST RESPIRATOR, SAFETY GOGGLES, AND RUBBER GLOVES. STOP
    LEAK IF WITHOUT RISK. DIKE IF NECESSARY. SWEEP UP AND PLACE IN BAG
    OR VACUUM UP WITH PROPER  FILTER EQUIPPED INSTRUMENT. AVOID
    CREATING DUST. CLEAN SURFACE THOROUGHLY TO REMOVE RESIDUAL
    CONTAMINATION. FOR LARGE SPILLS, FLUSH SPILL AREA WITH WATER SPRAY.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP IN TIGHTLY CLOSED CONTAINER.
    PROTECT FROM PHYSICAL DAMAGE, AIR, AND LIGHT. AVOID INCOMPATIBLE
    MATERIALS, ESPECIALLY COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS. USE ONLY IN
    WELL-VENTILATED AREAS. AVOID CONTACT WITH SK IN, EYES, AND
    CLOTHING. AVOID INHALATION.
Other Precautions:"EMPTY" CONTAINERS MAY CONTAIN PRODUCT RESIDUE AND
    MAY BE DANGEROUS. EMPTY CNTNRS SHOULD BE COMPLETELY DRAINED &
    BUNGED & THEN DISPOSED OF ACCORDING TO LOC, STATE, & FED REGS. MAY
    CAUSE BURNS OF GI TR ACT. SKIN & EYE IRRITANT. CAUSES SEVERE SKIN &
    EYE BURNS. EXTREMELY IRRITATING TO RESP TRACT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NIOSH APPROVED DUST RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:USE ONLY IN WELL-VENTILATED AREAS.
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
Eye Protection:ANSI APPROVED CHEMICAL WORKERS GOGGLES & FULL LENGTH
    FACESHIELD .
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH & DELUGE SHOWER MEETING ANSI DESIGN
    CRITERIA . PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER HANDLING.
Supplemental Safety and Health
FIRST AID PROC: SINCE REVERSION OF METHEMOGLOBIN TO HEMOGLOBIN OCCURS
    SPONT AFTER TERMINATION OF EXPOS, MOD DEGREES OF CYANOSIS NEED TO
    BE TREATED ONLY BY SUPPORTIVE MEASURES SUCH AS BED REST & OXYG I
    NHAL. THORO CLEANING OF ENTIRE CONTAM AREA OF BODY, INCL SCALP &
    NAILS, IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE. IF (OTHER INFO)
