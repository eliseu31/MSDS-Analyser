    AID IMMEDIATELY. SKIN: GET MEDICAL AID IMMEDIATELY. IMMEDIATELY
    FLUSH SKIN	W/PLENTY OF SOAP & WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES WHILE
    REMOVING CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & SHOES. INGEST: IF VICTIM IS
    CONSCIOUS & ALERT, GIVE 2-4 CUPFULS OF MILK OR WATER. NEVER GIVE

    IMMEDIATELY. INHAL: GET MEDICAL AID IMMEDIATELY. REMOVE FROM
    EXPOSURE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE
    ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS DIF FICULT, GIVE OXYGEN.
    NOTES TO MD: NONE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:=58.C, 136.4F
Autoignition Temp:=445.C, 833.F
Lower Limits:2.2%
Upper Limits:15.2%
Extinguishing Media:FOR SMALL FIRES, USE DRY CHEM, CARBON DIOXIDE,
    WATER SPRAY OR ALCOHOL-RESIST FOAM. USE WATER SPRAY TO COOL
    FIRE-EXPOSED CNTNRS. WATER MAY BE INEFTIVE. FOR LARGE FIRES, USE
    (SUPDAT)
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . CONTACT PROFESSIONAL FIRE-FIGHTERS IMMEDIATELY. COOL
    CONTAINERS W/FLOODING QUANTITIES OF WATER UNTIL WELL AFTER FIRE IS
    OUT. NFPA RATING:  HEALTH-1; FLAMMABILITY-2; REACTIVITY-0.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS CAN TRAVEL TO SOURCE OF IGNITION &
    FLASH BACK. USE WATER SPRAY TO KEEP FIRE-EXPOSED CONTAINERS COOL.
    FLAMMABLE LIQUID. VAPORS MAY BE HEAVIER THAN AIR. THEY CAN SPREAD
    ALONG GROUND & COLLECT IN  LOW OR CONFINED AREAS. VAPORS MAY FORM
    AN EXPLOSIVE MIXTURE W/AIR. CONTAINERS MAY EXPLODE WHEN HEATED.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:USE PROPER PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AS
    INDICATED IN EXPOSURE CONTROLS, PERSONAL PROTECTION. ABSORB SPILL
    W/INERT MATERIAL (EG, DRY SAND OR EARTH), THEN PLACE INTO CHEMICAL
    WASTE CONTAINER. DO NOT  FLUSH INTO A SEWER. REMOVE ALL SOURCES OF
    IGNIT. A VAPOR SUPPRESSING FOAM MAY BE USED TO REDUCE VAPORS. WATER
    SPRAY MAY REDUCE VAPOR BUT MAY NOT PREVENT IGNITION IN CLOSED
    SPACES.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP AWAY FROM HEAT, SPARKS & FLAME.
    KEEP AWAY FROM SOURCES OF IGNIT. STORE IN TIGHTLY CLOSED CNTNR.
    KEEP FROM CONTACT W/OXIDIZING MATLS. STORE IN A COOL, DRY,
    WELL-VENTD AREA AWAY FROM INCOMPATIBLE S UBSTANCES. WASH THOROUGHLY
    AFTER HNDLG. REMOVE CONTAM CLTHG & WASH BEFORE REUSE. USE W/ADEQ
    VENT.
Other Precautions:GROUND & BOND CNTNRS WHEN TRANSFERRING MATL. AVOID
    CNTCT W/EYES, SKIN & CLTHG. EMPTY CNTNRS RETAIN PROD RESIDUE (LIQ
    &/OR VAP) & CAN BE DANGEROUS. KEEP CNTNR TIGHTLY CLSD. AVOID CNTCT
    W/HEAT, SPKS & F LAME. AVOID INGEST & INHAL. DO NOT PRESSURIZE,
    CUT, WELD, BRAZE, SOLDER, DRILL, GRIND/EXPOSE EMPTY C NTNRS TO
    (SUPDAT)

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:FOLLOW THE OSHA RESPIRATOR REGULATIONS FOUND IN
    29 CFR 1910.134 OR EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 149. ALWAYS USE A NIOSH OR
    EUROPEAN STANDARD EN 149 APPROVED RESPIRATOR WHEN NECESSARY.
Ventilation:USE ADEQUATE GENERAL OR LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION TO KEEP
    AIRBORNE CONCENTRATIONS BELOW THE PERMISSIBLE EXPOSURE LIMITS.
