=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:SEE TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: CORROSIVE! INHALATION OF
    VAPORS CAN CAUSE COUGHING, CHOKING, INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSE,
    THROAT AND UPPER RESPIRATORY TRACT, AND IN SEVERE CASES, PULMONARY
    EDEMA, CIRCULATORY FAILURE, AND DE ATH. INGESTION: CORROSIVE!
    SWALLOWING HYDROCHLORIC ACID CAN CAUSE IMMEDIATE PAIN AND BURNS OF
    THE MOUTH, THROAT, ESOPHAGUS AND GI TRACT. MAY CAUSE NAUSEA,
    VOMITING AND DIARRHEA. SWALLOWING MAY BE FATA L. SKIN CONTACT:
    CORROSIVE! CAN CAUSE REDNESS, PAIN AND SEVERE SKIN BURNS.
    CONCENTRATED SOLUTIONS CAUSE DEEP ULCERS AND DISCOLOR SKIN. EYE
    CONTACT: CORROSIVE! VAPORS ARE IRRITATING AND MAY CAUSE DAMAG E TO
    THE EYES. (EFFECTS OF OVEREXPOSURE)
Effects of Overexposure:HEALTH HAZARDS: CONTACT MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS
    AND PERMANENT EYE DAMAGE. CHRONIC EXPOSURE: LONG-TERM EXPOSURE TO
    CONCENTRATED VAPORS MAY CAUSE EROSION OF TEETH. LONG TERM EXPOSURES
    SELDOM OCCUR DUE TO  THE CORROSIVE PROPERTIES OF THE ACID.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING SKIN
    DISORDERS OR EYE DISEASE MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS OF
    THIS SUBSTANCE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL
    RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. GET MED ATTN
    IMMED. INGEST: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING! GIVE LARGE QUANTITIES OF
    WATER OR  MILK IF AVAILABLE. NEVER GIVE ANYTHING BY MOUTH TO AN
    UNCON PERSON. GET MED ATTN IMMED. SKIN CONTACT: IN CASE OF CONTACT,
    IMMED FLUSH SKIN W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES WHILE
    REMOVING CON TAM CLTHG & SHOES. WASH CLTHG BEFORE REUSE. THOROUGHLY
    CLEAN SHOES BEFORE REUSE. GET MED ATTN IMMED. EYE CONTACT: IMMED
    FLUSH EYES W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES, LIFTING LOWER
    AND UPPER EY ELIDS OCCASIONALLY. GET MED ATTN IMMED.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:IF INVOLVED IN A FIRE, USE WATER SPRAY. NEUTRALIZE
    WITH SODA ASH OR SLAKED LIME.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA AND FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . STRUCTURAL FIREFIGHTER'S PROTECTIVE CLOTHING IS
    INEFFECTIVE FOR FIRES INVOLVING HYDROCHLORIC ACID. STAY AWAY FROM
    ENDS OF TANKS. COOL TANK S WITH WATER SPRAY UNTIL WELL AFTER FIRE
    IS OUT.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:EXTREME HEAT OR CONTACT WITH METALS CAN
    RELEASE FLAMMABLE HYDROGEN GAS. NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AN EXPLOSION
    HAZARD.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENT AREA OF LEAK OR SPILL. WEAR APPROP
    PERSONAL PROT EQUIP AS SPECIFIED IN EXPOS CTLS/PERSONAL PROT.
    ISOLATE HAZ AREA. KEEP UNNECESSARY & UNPROTECTED PERS FROM
    ENTERING. CONTAIN & RECOVER LIQ WHEN PO SSIBLE. NEUT W/ALKALINE
    MATL (SODA ASH, LIME), THEN ABSORB W/INERT MATL (EG, VERMICULITE,
    DRY SAND, EARTH), & PLACE IN A CHEM WASTE CNTNR. DO NOT USE COMBUST
    MATLS, SUCH AS SAWDUST. (SUPDAT)
Neutralizing Agent:NEUTRALIZE WITH ALKALINE MATERIAL (SODA ASH, LIME),
    THEN ABSORB WITH AN INERT MATERIAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY, VENTD STORAGE
    AREA W/ACID RESISTANT FLOORS & GOOD DRAINAGE. PROTECT FROM PHYSICAL
    DMG. KEEP OUT OF DIRECT SUNLIGHT & AWAY FROM HEAT, WATER & INCOMPAT
    MATLS. DO NOT WASH OUT CNTNR  & USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES. WHEN
    DILUTING, ACID SHOULD ALWAYS BE ADDED (TOXICOLOGICAL INFO)
Other Precautions:WHEN OPENING METAL CONTAINERS, USE NON-SPARKING TOOLS
    BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF HYDROGEN GAS BEING PRESENT.
    CONTAINERS OF THIS MATERIAL MAY BE HAZARDOUS WHEN EMPTY SINCE THEY
    RETAIN PRODUCT RESIDU ES (VAPORS, LIQUID); OBSERVE ALL WARNINGS AND
    PRECAUTIONS LISTED FOR THE PRODUCT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF THE EXPOS LIMIT IS EXCEEDED, A NIOSH APPRVD
    FULL FACEPIECE RESP W/AN ACID GAS CARTRIDGE MAY BE WORN UP TO 50
    TIMES THE EXPOS LIMIT OR MAXIMUM USE CONCENTRATION SPECIFIED BY THE
    APPROP REGULATORY AG ENCY OR RESP SUPPLIER, WHICHEVER IS LOWEST.
    FOR EMERGENCIES OR INSTANCES WHERE THE EXPOS LEVELS ARE NOT KNOWN,
    USE A NIOSH APPRVD (ECOLOGICAL INFO)
Ventilation:A SYSTEM OF LOCAL &/OR GENERAL EXHAUST IS RECOM TO KEEP
    EMPLOYEE EXPOS BELOW AIRBORNE EXPOS LIMS. LOCAL EXHAUST VENT IS
    GENERALLY PREFERRED (ECOLOGICAL INFO)
Protective Gloves:RUBBER OR NEOPRENE GLOVES.
Eye Protection:ANSI APPROVED CHEMICAL WORKERS GOGGLES & FULL LENGTH
    FACESHIELD .
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH & DELUGE SHOWER MEETING ANSI DESIGN
    CRITERIA . ADDITIONAL PROTECTION INCLUDING IMPERVIOUS BOOTS, APRON
    OR COVERALLS, AS NEEDED IN AREA OF UNUSUAL EXPOSURE TO PREVENT SKIN
    CONTACT.
