Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:TARGET ORGANS: CNS, RESPIRATORY SYSTEM
    AND HEART. EYES: VERY SLIGHT IRRITATION. RAPID VOLATILIZATION OF
    LIQUID MAY CAUSE FROSTBITE. SKIN: SLIGHT IRRITANT, CONTACT MAY
    CAUSE FROSTBITE. INHALATION: CONC ENTRATED VAPORS CAN PRODUCE RAPID
    ANESTHETIC EFFECTS, RESPIRATORY DEPRESSION, INCREASED SENSITIVITY
    OF THE HEART TO ADRENALINE, DEPRESSION OF CARDIAC FUNCTION, DEATH
    DUE TO ASPHYXIATION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NONE
Effects of Overexposure:IRRITATION, FROSTBITES AND PAIN, DROWSINESS,
    UNCONSCIOUSNESS, RAPID HEARTBEAT, IRREGULAR HEARTBEAT.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PREEXISTING HEART DISEASE OR
    COMPROMISED HEART FUNCTION SHOULD ONLY HAVE LIMITED EXPOSURE TO
    THIS MATERIAL.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SKIN: IF FROSTBITTEN, WARM SLOWLY W/WATER. FLUSH W/PLENTY OF
    WATER. EYES: FLUSH W/PLENTY OF CLEAN WATER FOR 15 MINS. INHALATION:
    REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. IF NOT BREATHING, GIVE CPR. IF BREATHING IS
    DIFFIC ULT, GIVE OXYGEN. INGESTION: NEVER GIVEANYTHING BY MOUTH TO
    AN UNCONSCIOUS PERSON. OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION IN ALL CASES.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONFLAMMABLE
Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:N/E
Extinguishing Media:USE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA APPROPRIATE FOR SURROUNDING
    FIRE CONDITIONS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS IF
    FIGHTING FIRES NEAR THIS PRODUCT DUE TO TOXICITY OF THERMAL
    DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS.KEEP CONTAINERS COOL.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:MIXTURES OF HFC-134A WITH AIR OR OTHER
    OXIDIZERS UNDER HIGH TEMPERATURE AND PRESSURE, CAN BE FLAMMABLE.IN
    TESTS CONDUCTED AT UP TO 170C, HFC-134A IS FLAMMABLE ONLY AT
    PRESSURES ABOVE 50PSIA AND WITH M ORE THAN 50% AIR BY
    VOLUME.MIXTURES CONTAINING HFC-134A SHOULD NOT BE USED FOR PRESSURE
    OR LEAK TESTING.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:REMOVE/EXTINGUISH IGNITION/COMBUSTION SOURCES.
    EVACUATE ENCLOSED SPACES UNTIL GAS IS DISPERSED. KEEP UPWIND. STOP
    LEAK IF POSSIBLE W/OUT RISK. DISPERSE GAS W/FLOOR-LEVEL FORCED-AIR
    VENTILATION. EXHAUS T VAPORS OUTDOORS. REMOVE FLAMES/HEAT

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP AWAY FROM IGNITION SOURCES AND
    DIRECT SUNLIGHT. STORE BELOW 120F. STORE IN TIGHTLY CLOSED
    CONTAINES. DO NOT REFILL THIS CYLINDER. EMPTY CONTAINERS CONTAIN
    HAZARDOUS RESIDUE.
Other Precautions:DON'T DROP, REUSE/REFILL CONTAINER. DON'T CUT, GRIND/
    WELD ON/NEAR CONTAINER. DON'T GET IN EYES, ON SKIN/CLOTHING. DON'T
    BREATHE VAPOR, MIST/GAS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IN INADEQUATELY VENTILATED AREAS, A NIOSH/MSHA
    APPROVED (TC-18C) SUPPLIED AIR RESPIRATOR/SCBA IS REQUIRED.
Ventilation:CHECK AIR FOR CONTAMINANT & FOR OXYGEN DEFICIENCY. USE
    LOCAL EXHAUST SYSTEM IF VENTILATION IS INADEQUATE.
Protective Gloves:SYNTHETIC RUBBER/NEOPRENE
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:WEAR APPROPRIATE CHEMICAL RESISTANT
    PROTECTIVE CLOTHING TO PREVENT SKIN CONTACT.
Work Hygienic Practices:REMOVE/LAUNDER CONTAMINATED CLOTHING BEFORE
    REUSE. DESTROY CONTAMINATED SHOES.
