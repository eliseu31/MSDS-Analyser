=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:LD50:(ORAL,RAT) >5 G/KG.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE:MINIMAL RESPIRATORY TRACT
    IRRITATION MAY OCCUR AS WITH EXPOSURE TO LARGE AMOUNTS OF ANY
    NON-TOXIC DUST. CHRONIC:RESULTS OBTAINED FROM A XEROX SPONSORED,
    CHRONIC TONER INHAL STUDY, DEMONSTRATED N O LUNG CHANGE IN RATS FOR
    LOWEST (1 MG/M3) EXPOS LEVEL (I.E. LEVEL MOST RELEVANT TO POTNTL
    HUMAN EXPOS). A VERY SLIGHT DEGREE OF FIBROSIS WAS NOTED IN 25% OF
    ANIMALS AT MIDDLE (4 MG/M3) EXPOS LEVEL, W HILE A SLIGHT DEGREE OF
    FIBROSIS WAS NOTED IN ALL ANIMALS AT HIGHEST (16 MG/M3) EXPOS
    LEVEL. THESE FINDINGS ARE ATTRIBUTED TO "LUNG OVERLOADING", A
    GENERIC RESPONSE TO EXCESSIVE AMTS OF ANY DUST RETAI NED IN LUNGS
    FOR (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:CARBON BLACK:IARC MONOGRAPHS ON
    EVALUATION OF CARCINOGENIC RISK OF CHEMICAL TO MAN:VOL 65, PG
    24-27, 1995:GROUP 2B.
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ:  PRLNG PERIOD.  THIS STUDY WAS
    CONDUCTED USING A SPECIAL TEST TONER TO COMPLY W/EPA TESTING
    PROTOCOL. THE TEST TONER WAS TEN TIMES MORE RESPIRABLE THAN
    COMMERCIALLY AVAIL XEROX TONER & WOULD  NOT BE FUNCTIONALLY
    SUITABLE FOR XEROX EQUIPMENT. MORE RESPIRABLE THAN COMMERCIALLY
    AVAIL XEROX TONER & WOULD NOT BE FUNCTIONALLY SUITABLE FOR XEROX
    EQUIPMENT.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE WHEN USED AS DESCRIBED BY
    PRODUCT LITERATURE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES:FLUSH W/WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. SKIN:WASH W/SOAP
    & WATER. INHAL:REMOVE FROM EXPOSURE. INGEST:DILUTE STOMACH CONTENTS
    W/SEVERAL GLASSES OF WATER.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:N.A.
Upper Limits:N.A.
Extinguishing Media:WATER, FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH APPROVED SCBA & FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . AVOID INHALATION OF SMOKE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NONE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SWEEP UP/VACUUM SPILLED TONER & CAREFULLY
    TRANSFER INTO SEALABLE WASTE CNTNR. SWEEP SLOWLY TO MIN GENERATION
    OF DUST DURING CLEAN-UP. IF VACUUM IS USED, MOTOR MUST BE RATED AS
    DUST TIGHT. CONDUCTIVE H OSE BONDED TO MACHINE SHOULD BE USED TO
    REDUCE STATIC BUILDUP (SEE FIRE & EXPLO DATA SECTION). RESIDUE CAN
    BE REMOVED W/SOAP & COLD WATER.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:AVOID PROLONGED INHALATION OF
    EXCESSIVE DUST.
Other Precautions:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE REQUIRED WHEN USED AS INTENDED IN XEROX
    EQUIPMENT. USE NIOSH APPROVED RESPIRATOR APPROPRIATE FOR EXPOSURE
    OF CONCERN .
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .NONE REQUIRED WHEN USED AS
    INTENDED IN XEROX EQUIP.
Eye Protection:ANSI APPROVED CHEMICAL WORKERS GOGGLES .
Other Protective Equipment:EYEWASH & DELUGE SHOWER MTG ANSI DESIGN
    CRITERIA . FOR USE OTHER THAN NORMAL CUSTOMER - OPERATING
    PROCEDURES (SUCH AS IN BULK TONER PROCESSING FACILITIES), GOGGLES &
    RESP MAY BE REQUIRED. (SUPDAT)
