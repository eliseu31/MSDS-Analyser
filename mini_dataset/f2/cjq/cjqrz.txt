===================  Toxicological Information	===================

Toxicological Information:ACUTE DERMAL (RABBIT) LD50 VALUES ARE
    ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN 2,000 MG/KG. THE 4-HOUR INHALATION
    LC50 VALUE IS ESTIMATED TO BE GREATER THAN 20 MG/L.
    2-METHOXY-1-PROPNAOL ACETATE WAS TESTED IN RAT S AND RABBITS FOR
    EMBRYOTOXIC POTENTIAL. IN RATRS, BIRTH DEFECTS WERE SEEN ONLY AT
    MATERNALLY TOXIC DOSES. HOWEVER, IN RABBITS EXPOSED TO IT VIA
    INHALATION TO 0, 0.2, 0.8, OR 3.0 MG/L FOR 6 HOURS PER  DAY THROUGH
    GESTION DAYS 6 TO 18, TERATOGENICITY WAS EVIDENT. THE FETOTOXIC
    EFFECTS OF TOLUENE SEEN IN LABORATORY ANIMALS ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE
    SEEN IN HUMANS.
