Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:REPORTS HAVE ASSOCIATED REPEATED AND
    PROLONGED OCCUPATIONAL OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS WITH PERMANENT
    BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY DELIBERATELY
    CONCENTRATING AND INHALING CONTE NTS MAY BE HARMFUL OR FATAL. ACUTE
    OR REPEATED OVEREXPOSURE BY INHALING VAPORS MAY CAUSE RED BLOOD
    CELL DAMAGE AND KIDNEY INJURY. INGESTION MAY CAUSE POSSIBLE KIDNEY
    DAMAGE. THIS PRODUCT CAN BE ABSORB ED THROUGH SKIN CAUSING ORGAN
    DAMAGE. BASED ON THE PRESENCE OF 2-PROPOXYETHANOL, THIS PRODUCT MAY
    CAUSE MODERATE TO SEVERE EYE IRRITATION SEEN AS MARKED EXCESS
    REDNESS AND SWELLING OF THE CONJUNCTIVA  AND IS PRESUMED TO BE
    (EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:THIS PRODUCT CONTAINS NO REPORTED
    CARCINOGENS OR SUSPECTED CARCINOGENS.
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: MODERATELY TOXIC. BASED ON PRESENCE
    OF AROMATIC NAPHTHA & STODDARD SOLVENT, THIS PRODUCT MAY CAUSE
    NOSE, THROAT & EYE IRRITATION. BASED ON PRESENCE OF AROMATIC
    NAPHTHA, HIGH VAPOR CONCENTRAT IONS MAY CAUSE CNS DEPRESSION; &
    INGESTION OF THIS PRODUCT WILL CAUSE IRRITATION OF GI TRACT & MAY
    CAUSE EFFECTS RESEMBLING THOSE FROM INHALATION OF VAPOR. STODDARD
    SOLVENT IS A CNS DEPRESSANT & A MUC OUS MEMBRANE IRRITANT. SYMPTOMS
    OF OVEREXPOSURE INCLUDE DIZZINESS, HEADACHE, INTOXICATION WITH
