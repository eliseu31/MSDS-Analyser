    CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM. LIVER, KIDNEYS. BLOOD, LUNGS. ALSO, SEE
    TOXICOLOGICAL INFORMATION.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SKIN: FLUSH SKIN WITH WATER. EYES: CONTAMINATION OF EYES
    SHOULD BE TREATED BY IMMEDIATE AND PROLONGED IRRIGATION WITH
    COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. INHALATION: IF
    INHALED, REMOVE T O FRESH AIR. IF NOT BREATHING GIVE ARTIFICIAL
    RESPIRATION. IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT, GIVE OXYGEN. INGESTION: IF
    SWALLOWED, WASH OUT MOUTH WITH WATER PROVIDED PERSON IS CONSCIOUS.
    CALL A PHYSICIAN. RE MOVE AND WASH CONTAMINATED CLOTHING PROMPTLY.
