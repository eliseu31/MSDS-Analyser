=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INGEST:CALL MD IMMEDIATELY . INHAL:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.
    SUPPORT BREATHING (GIVE O*2/ARTF RESP) . EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH
    W/POTABLE WATER FOR A MINIMUM OF 15 MINUTES, SEEK ASSISTANCE FROM
    MD	. SKIN:FLUSH W/COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER. CALL MD .

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:WATER FOG, ALCOHOL FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL, CO*2.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPRVD SCBA & FULL PROT EQUIP
    . ISOLATE CNTNRS FROM HEAT, ELEC EQUIP, SPKS & OPEN FLAMES. KEEP
    THEM COOL. PROT PERS AGAINST (SUP DAT)
