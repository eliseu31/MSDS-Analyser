Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE:IRRTATING EFFECTS INCREASE WITH
    STRENGTH OF SOLUTION AND TIME OF EXPOSURE. NHAL:FUMES FROM SPILLS
    ARE VERY IRRITATING TO MUCOUS MEMBRANES. VERY LITTLE HAZARD FROM
    PROPERLY STORED SOLUTION. SKIN: IRRITANT, REDDENING OF SKIN, SKIN
    DAMAGE. EYE:SEVERE IRRIT.(EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT

    MEMBRANES OF THE MOUTH, THROAT, AND STOMACH PAIN AND POSSIBLE
    ULCERATION. CHRONIC:CONSTANT IRRITANT TO EYES, THROAT.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES:COPIOUS EYE WASH W/WATER FOR AT LST 15 MIN HOLDING
    EYELIDS APART TO ENSURE FLUSHING OF ENTIRE EYE SURF. CONSULT AN EYE
    SPECIALIST IMMED. SKIN:WASH CONTAM AREAS W/PLENTY OF WATER. REMOVE
    CONTAM CL THG & FOOTWEAR & WASH CLTHG BEFORE REUSE. SEEK MED ATTN
    IMMED. INHAL:GET PERSON OUT OF CONTAM AREAS TO FRESH AIR.
    INGEST:DRINK WATER, MILK, & OBTAIN MED ATTN. DO NOT USE BAKING
    SODA/ACID ANTIDOTES.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONFLAMMABLE
Lower Limits:NONFLAMMABLE
Upper Limits:NONFLAMMABLE
Extinguishing Media:MEDIA SUITABLE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE .
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPRVD SCBA & FULL PROT EQUIP
    . AVOID FUMES FROM SPILLED/EXPOSED LIQ, DILUTE COPIOUSLY, VENT & BE
    PREPARED TO USE RESP PROT IF (SUP DAT)
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:BLEACH DECOMPOSES WHEN HEATED; DECOMP
    PRODS MAY CAUSE CNTNRS TO RUPTURE/EXPLODE. VIGOROUS REACTION POSS
    W/ORG MATL OR OXIDIZING AGENTS; MAY RESULT IN A FIRE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:FLUSH W/WATER TO DILUTE AS MUCH AS POSS, AVOID
    HEAT & CONTAM W/ACID MATLS. DO NOT USE COMBUST MATLS SUCH AS
    SAWDUST TO ABSORB HYPOCHLORITE. IF NOT DILUTED, MAY SERIOUSLY
    AFFECT AQUATIC LIFE. DO NOT AL LOW SPILLED MATL TO ENTER SEWERS OR
    STREAMS.
Neutralizing Agent:REDUCING AGENTS SUCH AS BISULFITES/FERROUS SALT
    SOLNS; SOME HEAT WILL BE PRDCED.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:NORMAL HANDLING OF HOUSEHOLD BOTTLED
    BLEACH REQUIRES SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AS STATED ON THE LABELS.
Other Precautions:FULL PROT SHOULD BE PROVIDED WHEN HNDLG BULK
    SHIPMENTS OF CONC, INDUST BLEACH SOLNS. STORE IN VENTED, CLSD,
