=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHAL:LOW CONCS (3-5% BY VOL) CAUSE
    INCR RESP & HDCH. CONCS OF 8-15% CAUSE HDCH, NAUS & VOMIT WHICH MAY
    LEAD TO UNCON IF NOT MOVED TO OPEN AIR/GIVEN OXYGEN. HIGHER CONCS
    CAUSE RAPID CIRCULATORY INSUFF ICIENCY LEADING TO COMA & DEATH.
    WHEN REFRIGERATED LIQ CARBON DIOXIDE IS VAPORIZED THRU ORIFICE, IT
    CAN(EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ:FORM SOLID PARTICLES OF CARBON DIOXIDE
    ("SNOW"/"DRY ICE" PWDR). CONTINUOUS DERMAL CONT W/THIS COLD SNOW
    COULD RSLT IN FROSTBITE/CRYOGENIC (FREEZE) "BURNS". CONT
    W/LIQ/SOLID CAN PRDCE FROSTBIT E & FREEZE BURNS. NOTE:EXCEPT WHERE
    SPECIFIED, HLTH HAZ DATA & MOST OF OTHER DATA IN THIS MSDS ARE FOR
    GASEOUS (SUPDAT)
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:PROMPT MED ATTN IS MANDATORY IN ALL CASES OF OVEREXP TO
    CARBON DIOXIDE. RESCUE PERS SHOULD BE EQUIPPED W/NIOSH/MSHA APPRVD
    SCBA. INGEST:CALL MD IMMED . INHAL:CONSCIOUS PERS SHOULD BE
    ASSISTED TO  UNCONTAM AREA & INHALE FRESH AIR. QUICK REMOVAL FROM
    CONTAM AREA IS MOST IMPORTANT. UNCON PERS SHOULD BE MOVED TO
    UNCONTAM AREA, GIVEN MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION & SUPP OXYGEN.
    FURTHER (ING 3)

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:MEDIA SUITABLE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE . NONFLAMMABLE,
    INERT GAS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SCBA & FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT .
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HAZARDOUS MIXTURES OF OTHER LIQUIDS,
    SOLIDS OR GASES: FORMS CARBONIC ACID IN THE PRESENCE OF WATER.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:EVACUATE ALL PERS FROM AFFECTED AREA. USE
    APPROP PROT EQUIP. PROVIDE VENT. PERS SHOULD AVOID CONT W/VERY COLD
    MATLS/EXCESSIVE INHALS OF GAS. SOLID CARBON DIOXIDE IS GENRLY
    DELIVERED TO CUSTOMERS IN KR AFT-PAPER-WRAPPED BLOCKS WHICH WEIGH

Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DRY CARBON DIOXIDE CAN BE HNDLD W/MOST
    COMMON STRUCTURAL MATLS. MOIST CARBON DIOXIDE IS CORR BY ITS FORM
    OF CARBONIC ACID.
Other Precautions:FOR THESE APPLICATIONS, 316, 309 & 310 STAINLESS
    STEELS MAY BE USED AS WELL AS HASTELOY A, B & C & MONEL. FERROUS
    NICKEL ALLOYS ARE SLIGHTLY CORRODED. AT SOLID TEMPS, PLASTICS &
    ELASTOMERS MAY BE EMBR ITTLED. FOR ADDNL RECS, CONSULT (ING 13)

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED POSITIVE PRESSURE AIR LINE
    RESPIRATOR W/FULL FACEPIECE & ESCAPE AIR SUPPLY OR SCBA SHOULD BE
    AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY USE OR IN NON-ROUTINE SITUATIONS W/EXPOSURE
    ABOVE TLV.
Ventilation:PROVIDE GENERAL & LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION TO MEET TLV
    REQUIREMENTS.
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
Eye Protection:ANSI APPROVED CHEM WORKERS GOGGS(ING 14)
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH FOUNTAIN & DELUGE SHOWER WHICH MEET
    ANSI DESIGN CRITERIA . WORKERS MAY REQ ADDNL PROT CLTHG (ING 15)
Work Hygienic Practices:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Supplemental Safety and Health
EFTS OF OVEREXP:CARBON DIOXIDE. CARBON DIOXIDE IS THE MOST POWERFUL
    CEREBRAL VASODILATOR KNOWN. INHALING LG CONCS CAUSES RAPID
    CIRCULATORY INSUFFICIENCY LEADING TO COMA & DEATH. CHRONIC, HARMFUL
    EFTS  ARE NOT KNOWN FROM RPTD INHAL OF LOW (3-5% CONCS). FROSTBITE
    EFTS ARE A CHANGE IN COLOR OF SKIN TO GRAY/WHITE (ING 2)
