Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SHORT TERM EXPO:SULFURIC ACID MAY
    CAUSE IRRIT OF EYES/NOSE/THROAT. PROLONGED CONTACT MAY CAUSE SEVERE
    BURNS. LONG TERM EXPOSURE:REPEATED CONTACT CAUSES IRRIT & SKIN
    BURNS. REPEATED EXPO TO MIST MAY CA USE ERROSION OF TEETH, CHRONIC
    EYE IRRIT &/OR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF NOSE/THROAT/BRONCHIAL TUBES.
Effects of Overexposure:ACID CONTACT MAY CAUSE IRRIT OF
    EYES/NOSE/THROAT. BREATHING OF MIST MAY PRODUCE RESPIRATORY
    DIFFICULTY. CONTACT W/EYES & SKIN CAUSES IRRITATION & SKIN BURNS.
    SULFURIC ACID IS A CORROSIVE CHEMICAL.

    EMPHYSEMA, DENTAL ERROSION, AND TRACEOBRONCHITIS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:FLUSH CONTACTED AREA W/LG AMTS OF WATER FOR @LEAST 15MINS.
    REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & OBTAIN MED ATTN. IF SWALLOWED GIVE
    LG VOLS OF WATER. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING, OBTAIN MED TREATMENT.
    EYEWASH & S HOWER STATIONS SHOULD BE MADE AVAILABLE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SULFURIC ACID:DILUTE SPILL CAUTIOUSLY W/5-6
    VOLUMES OF WATER & GRADUALLY NEUTRALIZE W/SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA
    ASH OR LIME. WHEN EXPOSURE LEVEL IS NOT KNOWN WEAR NIOSH APPROVED
    POSITIVE PRESSURE SELF- CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. (REF
    DOTUN2796).
Neutralizing Agent:SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA ASH, LIME.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE AWAY FROM REACTIVE
    MATERIAL-STRONG OXIDIZING AGENST SUCH AS HOT NITRIC ACID, ETC.
Other Precautions:SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA ASH, SAND, OR LIME SHOULD BE
    KEPT IN SAME GENERAL AREA FOR EMERGENCY USE. HYDROGEN GAS IR
    GENERATED BY BATTERY ESPECIALLY WHEN CHARGING. IF BATTERY CASE IS
    BROKEN AVOID DIRECT  CONTACT W/INTERNAL COMPONENTS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:ACID GAS RESP REQUIRED WHEN PEL IS EXCEEDED OR
    EMPLOYEE WITNESSES RESP IRRIT.
