=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANT &
    IRRITANT. INHALATION OF LOW CONCENTRATIONS WILL, CAUSE EXCITEMENT
    &/OR DISORIENTATION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:THIS COMPOUND CONTAINS NO INGREDIENTS AT
    CONCENTRATIONS OF 0.1% OR GREATER THAT ARE CARCINOGENS OR SUSPECT
    CARCINOGENS.
Effects of Overexposure:CONTACT WITH LIQUID WILL CAUSE FROSTBITE,
    IRRITATION OR BLINDNESS. BEING A SIMPLE ASPHYXIANT, INHALATION AT
    HIGH CONCENTRATIONS SO AS TO EXCLUDE AN ADEQUATE SUPPLY OF OXYGEN
    TO THE LUNGS WILL CAUSE UN CONSCIOUSNESS AND POSSIBLE DEATH.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:PROMPT MEDICAL ATTENTION IS MANDATORY IN ALL CASES OF
    OVEREXPOSURE TO THIS FUEL GAS MIXTURE. INHALATION-MOVE TO AN
    UNCONTAMINATED AREA & INHALE FRESH AIR. REMOVE QUICKLY. GIVE
    MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITA TION & SUPPLEMENTAL OXYGEN. FURTHER
    TREATMENT SHOULD BE SYMPTOMATIC & SUPPORTIVE. SKIN-REMOVE
    CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & FLUSH AREAS WITH LUKE WARM WATER. DO NOT
    USE HOT WATER.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:CC
Flash Point:144F,62C
Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:850F
Lower Limits:3.0
Upper Limits:11.0
Extinguishing Media:WATER FOG, DRY CHEMICAL FOAM.
Fire Fighting Procedures:DO NOT EXTINGUISH. KEEP CYLINDER COOL WITH
    WATER FOG. IF FLAME IS EXTINGUISHED, REOMVE ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION
    & ALLOW CONTENTS TO VENT. INCREASE VENTILATION.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:GAS IS HEAVIER THAN AIR AND MAY TRAVEL A
    CONSIDRABLE DISTANCE TO A SOURCES OF IGNITION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:EVACUATE ALL PERSONNEL FROM AREA. USE
    APPROPIATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. IF LEAK IS IN USER'S EQUIPMENT, BE
    CERTAIN TO PURGE PIPING WITH AN INERT GAS PRIOR TO ATTEMPTING
    REPAIRS. IF LEAK IS IN CONTAINER  OR CONTAINER VALVE, CONTACT THE
    CLOSETS SUPPLIER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:USE ONLY IN WELL-VENTILATED AREAS.
    VALAVE PROTECTION CAPS MUST REMAIN IN PLACE. DO NOT DRAG, SLIDE,
    ROLL CYLINDERS. DO NOT HEAT CYLINDERS.
Other Precautions:PROTECT CYLINDERS FROM PHYSICAL DAMAGE. STORE IN
    COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTLATED AREA OF NON-COMBUSTIBLE CONSTRUCTION AWAY
    FROM HEAVILY TRAFFICKED AREAS & EMERGENCY EXISTS. DO NOT ALLOW
    STORAGE TEMPERATURE  TO EXCEED 130F. STORE UPRIGHT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:RESPIRATORY PROTECTION IS NOT NORMALLY REQUIRED.
    DO NOT ENTER AREA OF HIGH CONCENTRATIONS UNTIL FIRST PURGING WITH
    INERT GAS AND THEN VENTILATING WITH AIR.
Ventilation:PROVIDE LOCAL EXHAUST OR MECHANICAL VENTILATION IF WELDING
    OR CUTTING IN CONFINED AREAS.
Protective Gloves:LEATHER GLOVES.
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES W/FILTER LENSES, SHADE 4.
Other Protective Equipment:APRONS WHEN WELDING, CUTTING OR BRAZING.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH THOROUGHLY AFTER HANDLING AND BEFORE
    EATING, DRINKING OR SMOKING. LAUNDER CONTAMINATED CLOTHING BEFORE
    REUSE.
Supplemental Safety and Health
ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT SHOULD BE NON-SPARKING OR EXPLOSION PROOF.
    WARNING: ANY LEAKS OF MAPP GAS PRESENTS GREAT DANGER OF EXPLOSION
    OR FIRE. KEEP ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION AWAY.
