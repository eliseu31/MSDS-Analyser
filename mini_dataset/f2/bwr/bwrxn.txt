    METHYLENE CHLORIDE IS *
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NTP HAS CLASSIFIED METHYLENE CHLORIDE AS
    CARCINOGENIC IN RATS AND MICE AT HIGH LEVELS OF EXPOSURE.
Effects of Overexposure:* METABOLIZED BY THE BODY TO CARBON MONOXIDE
    WHICH REDUCES THE BLOOD OXYGEN CARRYING CAPACITY. CHRONIC: REPORTS
    ASSOCIATE REPEATED/PROLONGED OVEREXPOSURE W/PERMANENT BRAIN &
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. PRO LONGED AND REPEATED BREATHING OF SPRAY
    MIST/SANDING DUST OVER PERIOD OF YEARS CAUSE DUST DISEASE OF THE
    LUNGS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE WHEN USED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
    SAFE HANDLING AND USE INFORMATION.
