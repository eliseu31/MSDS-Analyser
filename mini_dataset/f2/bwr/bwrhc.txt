=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:LD50 (ORAL RAT) IS 2140 MG/KG (H2SO4)
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION OF
    RESPIRATORY TRACT, EYES, SKIN OR GI TRACT. MAY CAUSE BURNS OF SKIN,
    EYES, OR GI TRACT. MAY CAUSE CORNEAL DAMAGE OR BLINDNESS. INGESTION
    OF LEAD MAY CAUSE SYSTEMIC POISON ING. CHRONIC: PROLONGED OR
    REPEATED EXPOSURE MAY CAUSE TOOTH EROSION, INFLAMMATION OF NOSE,
    THROAT AND BRONCHIAL TUBES.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:PER MFR LEAD COMPOUNDS ARE LISTED BY
    IARC AS 2B (SUSPECTED-ANIMAL DATA) CARCINOGEN. LACK PROOF IN HUMANS
    AT PRESENT.
Effects of Overexposure:INHALATION: BURNING SENSATION IN NOSE, THROAT
    AND LUNGS, COUGHING, WHEEZING, SHORTNESS OF BREATH. EYES: REDNESS,
    TEARING, BLURRED VISION, BURNS, SEVERE PAIN. SKIN: SEVERE PAIN,
    BURNS, REDNESS, RASH, I TCHING. INGESTION: BURNS OF MOUTH, THROAT,
    AND ESOPHAGUS, SEVERE STOMACH PAIN, NAUSEA, VOMITING, LOSS OF
    APPETITE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH A HISTORY OF AILMENTS
    OR WITH A PRE-EXISTING DISEASE INVOLVING THE RESPIRATORY TRACT OR
    TEETH MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FROM EXPOSURE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESUSCITATE IF NOT BREATHING.
    GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER
    FOR 15 MINUTES HOLDING EYELIDS OPEN. GET PROMPT MEDICAL ATTENTION.
    SKIN :REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING. WASH WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR
    15 MINUTES. GET MEDICAL ADVICE.  INGESTION:DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING.
    GIVE NOTHING BY MOUTH IF UNCONSCIOUS. GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL
    ATTENTION.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:USE DRY CHEMICAL, CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM.
Fire Fighting Procedures:IF BATTERIES ARE ON CHARGE, SHUT OFF POWER.
    USE OF WATER MAY CAUSE SPATTERING DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF MOLTEN
    LEAD. WEAR SCBA AND ACID RESISTANT CLOTHING.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HIGHLY FLAMMABLE HYDROGEN GAS IS
    GENERATED DURING CHARGING AND OPERATION OF BATTERIES.TO AVOID RISK
    OF FIRE/EXPLOSION,KEEP SPARKS & SOURCES OF IGNITION AWAY.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:STOP FLOW OF MATERIAL. CONTAIN/ABSORB WITH DRY
    SAND, EARTH, VERMICULITE. DO NOT USE COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS. IF
    POSSIBLE, CAREFULLY NEUTRALIZE SPILLED ELECTROLYTE WITH SODA ASH,
    LIME, ETC. WEAR ACID-RES ISTANT CLOTHING/BOOTS/GLOVES/FACESHIELD.
Neutralizing Agent:USE SODA ASH OR BAKING SODA TO NEUTRALIZE THE
    ELECTROLYTE.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED
    PLACE WITH ADEQUATE CONTAINMANT IN CASE SPILLS OCCUR. KEEP AWAY
    FROM INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS.
Other Precautions:AVOID DAMAGE TOCONTAINERS. UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS OF
    USE,EXPOSURE TO LEAD/LEAD CONTAINING COMPOUNDS DOES NOT
    OCCUR.SHOULD A BATTERY BREAK OPEN & A LEAD SPILL OCCUR,PRECAUTIONS
    SHOULD BE TAKEN TO PREV ENT LEAD DUST FROM BECOMING AIRBORN.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS OF USE, RESPIRATORY
    PROTECTION IS NOT REQUIRED. HOWEVER, IF CONDITIONS ARISE THAT
    REQUIRE THEIR USE, USE ONLY NIOSH/MSHA RESPIRATORS APPROVED FOR
    DUST, FUME AND MIST.
Ventilation:BATTERY CHARGING AREAS MUST BE ADEQUATELY VENTILATED TO
    PREVENT HAZARDOUS CONCENTRATIONS OF FLAMMABLE GAS OR ACID MIST.
Protective Gloves:RUBBER GLOVES APPROVED FOR SULFURIC ACID
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SPLASH GOGGLES AND FACE SHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH STATION AND SAFETY SHOWER.
    INDUSTRIAL-TYPE IMPERVIOUS WORK CLOTHING, BOOTS AND APRON AS
    REQUIRED.
Work Hygienic Practices:OBSERVE GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE PRACTICES AND
    RECOMMENDED PROCEDURES. LAUNDER CONTAMINATED CLOTHING BEFORE REUSE.
