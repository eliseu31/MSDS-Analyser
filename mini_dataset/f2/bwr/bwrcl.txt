=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NON FLAMMABLE
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER, NEUTRALIZE W/CHEMICALLY BASIC SUBSTANCES
    SUCH AS SODA ASH, DRY CHEMICALS OR INERT MATERIALS.
Fire Fighting Procedures:USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SCBA & FULL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT . KEEP CONTAINERS COOL. MOVE CONTAINERS FROM FIRE OR
    IGNITION SOURCE.
