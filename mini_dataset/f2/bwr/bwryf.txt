=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF ENGINEERING CONTROLS DO NOT MAINTAIN AIRBORNE
    CONCENTRATIONS TO AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL, AN APPROVED RESPIRATOR MUST
    BE WORN. RRESPIRATOR TYPE: ORGANIC VAPOR. IF RESPIRATORS ARE USED,
    A PROGRAM SHOULD  BE INSTITUTED TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA
    STANDARD 29 CFR 1910.134.
Ventilation:GOOD GENERAL VENTILATION (TYPICALLY 10 AIR CHANGES/HR)
    SHOULD BE USED. VENTILATION RATES SHOULD BE MATCHED TO CONDITIONS.
Protective Gloves:WEAR IMPERVIOUS GLOVES AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING
    APPROPRIATE FOR RISK OF EXPOSURE
Eye Protection:WEAR SAFETY GLASSES WITH SIDE SHIELDS (OR GOGGLES).
