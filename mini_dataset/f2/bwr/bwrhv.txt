Respiratory Protection:RESPIRATORY PROTECTION IS NOT NEEDED IF
    CONCENTRATIONS ARE CONTROLLED. IF CONCENTRATIONS EXCEED TLV (1000
    PPM), USE A NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED RESPIRATOR FOR ORGANIC VAPORS. IN
    VERY HIGH CONCS, A NIOSH/MSH A APPROVED SCBA SHOULD BE USED.
Ventilation:NEVER USE IN CLSD/CONFINED SPACE. LOCAL EXHST MAY BE
    NECESSARY TO REDUCE CONCS BELOW TLV (1000 PPM).
