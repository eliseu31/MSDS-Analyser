=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:TLV FOR SULFURIC ACID IS 1 MG/M3.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:NO	Skin:NO  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:TARGET ORGANS:EYE, SKIN, CNS, KIDNEY.
    ACUTE- SULFURIC ACID CAN CAUSE EYE, SKIN, RESPIRATORY & DIGESTIVE
    TRACTS IRRITATION, BURNS, CORNEAL & LUNG DAMAGE. NO POSSIBILITY OF
    OVER EXPOSURE OF LEAD UNLESS  BATTERY IS DESTROYED. CHRONIC- LEAD
    MAYCAUSE ANEMIA, KIDNEY & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. ACID CAN DAMAGE
    LUNGS & TEETH.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:CONTAINS LEAD AND ARSENIC.
Effects of Overexposure:LOSS OF APPETITE, DIARRHEA, CONSTIPATION,
    CRAMPING, LACK OF SLEEP, FATIGUE, EYE, SKIN, GASTROINTESTINAL AND
    RESPIRATORY TRACTS IRRITATION AND BURNS; CORNEAL, TEETH AND LUNG
    DAMAGE
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:INORGANIC LEAD AND ITS COMPOUNDS
    CAN AGGRAVATE CHRONIC FORMS OF KIDNEY, LIVER AND NEUROLOGIC
    DISEASES. SULFURIC ACID MISTS CAN AGGRAVATE SKIN DISEASES SUCH AS
    ECZEMA, DERMATITIS AND LUNG DISEASES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY IN ALL CASES OF
    EXPOSURE. EYES/SKIN:FLUSH WITH WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. KEEP EYELIDS
    OPEN. INHALATION:MOVE TO FRESH AIR. PROVIDE OXYGEN IF NEEDED.
    INGESTION:DO NOT IN DUCE VOMITING.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NON-FLAMMABLE
Lower Limits:4.1 HYDROGEN
Upper Limits:74.2HYDROGEN
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER, CARBON DIOXIDE OR DRY CHEMICAL ON FIRE
    IN THE AREA.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND
    NIOSH-APPROVED SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS WITH FULL
    FACEPIECE OPERATED IN THE POSITIVE PRESSURE MODE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN GASES ARE PRODUCED IN
    THE CELLS DURING NORMAL BATTERY OPERATION. HYDROGEN IS FLAMMABLE
    AND CAN CAUSE EXPLOSION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENTS. REMOVE
    COMBUSTIBLES & IGNITION SOURCES (H2 MAY BE PRESENT). CONTAIN BY
    DIKING & COVER SPILL WITH SODA ASH/QUICKLIME. MIX WELL. CHECK THAT
    MIXTURE IS NEUTRAL. COLLECT & PLAC E IN A DRUM. DO NOT FLUSH TO
    SEWER. VENTILATE AREA
Neutralizing Agent:SODA ASH (SODIUM CARBONATE), QUICKLIME (CALCIUM
    OXIDE)

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE NEAR EYEWASH FOUNTAIN AND SAFETY
    SHOWER. STORAGE AREA SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH A DRAIN WHICH CAPTURES
    SPILLS OF ACID FOR PROPER DISPOSAL.
Other Precautions:KEEP TERMINALS COVERED IN PLASTIC CASE. AVOID
    SHORTING BATTERIES. DO NOT CRACK OR OVERCHARGE BATTERIES. KEEP
    LIGHTED CIGARETTES, SPARKS, AND FLAMES AWAY FROM CHARGING
    BATTERIES. KEEP OUT OF REACH OF C HILDREN.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============
