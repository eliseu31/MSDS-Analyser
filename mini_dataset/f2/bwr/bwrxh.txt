Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:HELIUM IS NONTOXIC, BUT MAY CAUSE
    SUFFOCATION BY DISPLACING OXYGEN IN AIR. EXPSOURE TO
    OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERES MAY CAUSE DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, VOMITING,
    DIMINISHED MENTAL ALERTNESS, LOSS OF CONSCIOU SNESS & DEATH. IT
    SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED THAT COLLAPSE & ASPHYXIATION MAY OCCUR W/OUT
    EXPERIENCING ANY(EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL: PERS SUFFERING FROM LACK OF O*2 SHOULD BE MOVED INTO
    FRESH AIR. IF VICTIM IS NOT BRTHG, ADMIN ARTF RESP. IF BRTHG IS
    DFCLT, ADMIN O*2. OBTAIN PROMPT MED ATTN. EYE: FLUSH/POTABLE WATER
    FOR AT LE AST 15 MINS. SEE MD. SKIN: FLUSH/COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF
    WATER. SEE MD. INGEST: CALL MD IMMEDIATELY.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:MATL IS NONFLAMM. HELIUM NEITHER BURNS NOR SUPPORTS
    COMBUSTION. USE EXTING MEDIA APPROP FOR SURROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPRVD SCBA & FULL PROT EQUIP.
    HELIUM WILL ACT AS SIMPLE ASPHYX IF DISPLACES OXYGEN. IF POSS,
    REMOVE HELIUM CYLINDERS FROM FIRE(SUPDAT)
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:PRESSURE CAN BUILD UP DUE TO HEAT &
    CYLINDER MAY EXPLODE IF PRESSURE RELIEF DEVICES SHOULD FAIL TO
    RELIEVE PRESSURE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:EVAC ALL UNNEC PERS FROM AFFECTED AREA. SHUT
    OFF SOURCE OF HELIUM IF POSS. VENT ENCLSD AREAS/REMOVE CYLINDERS TO
    AN OUTDOOR LOCATION TO PVNT FORM/OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATM. IF LEAKING
    FROM CNTNR/VALVE. CON T CLOSEST BIG THREE INDUSTRIES
    LOCATION/SUPPLIER.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE & USE W/ADEQ VENT. CYLINDERS
    SHOULD BE STORED UPRIGHT W/VALVE PROT CAP IN PALCE & FIRMLY SECURED
    TO VNT FALLING/BEING KNOCKED OVER.
Other Precautions:PROT CYLINDERS FROM PHYSICAL DMG; DO NOT DRAG, ROLL,
    SLIDE OR DROP. USE A SUITABLE HAND TRUCK FOR CYLINDER MOVEMENT. DO
    NOT ALLOW THE TEMP WHERE CYLINDERS ARE STORED TO EXCEED 125F(52C).
    NEVER STRIKE  A WELDING ARC ON ANY COMPRESSED(SUPDAT)

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SCBA OR POSITIVE
    PRESSURE AIR LINE W/MASK IN OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ADTMOSPHERES.
    RESPIRATORS WILL NOT FUNCTION.
Ventilation:LOCAL/MECHANICAL: ADEQUATE TO AVOID LOWERING OXYGEN CONTENT
    TO BELOW 19.5% (OXYGEN-DEFICIENT ATMOSPHERE).
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
Eye Protection:ANSI APPRVD SAFETY GLASSES.
Other Protective Equipment:SAFETY SHOES WHEN HANDLING CYLINDERS.

Supplemental Safety and Health
FIRE FIGHT PROC:AREA/COOL W/WATER TO AVOID EXCESS PRESS BUILDUP. OTHER
    PREC: GAS CYLINDER. REFILLING CYLINDERS W/OUT CONSENT OF CYLINDER
    OWNER IS A VIOLATION OF FEDERAL LAW(CFR). DO NOT ALLOW ANYONE T O
    INHALE HELIUM FROM FILLING EQUIP/FROMBALLOONS. RAPID SUFFOCATION
    CAN TAKE PLACE BY REDUCING CONC OF O*2 IN AIR(ING 2)
