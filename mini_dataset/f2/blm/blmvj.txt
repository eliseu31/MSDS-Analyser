=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: SULFURIC ACID MAY CAUSE
    IRRITATION OF EYES, NOSE AND THROAT. PROLONGED CONTACT MAY CAUSE
    SEVERE BURNS. CHRONIC: REPEATED CONTACT CAUSES IRRITATION AND SKIN
    BURNS. REPEATED EXPOSURE TO MIST MAY  CAUSE EROSION OF TEETH,
    CHRONIC EYE IRRITATION AND/OR CHRONIC INFLAMMATION OF THE NOSE,
    THROAT AND BRONCHIAL TUBES.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:LEAD IS CONSIDERED A PROBABLE
    CARCINOGEN, FOR WHICH THERE IS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE.
Effects of Overexposure:ACID CONTACT MAY CAUSE IRRITATION OF EYES, NOSE
    AND THROAT. BREATHING OF MIST MAY PRODUCE RESPIRATORY DIFFICULTY.
    CONTACT WITH EYES AND SKIN CAUSES IRRITATION AND SKIN BURNS.
    SULFURIC ACID IS A CORROS IVE CHEMICAL. OVEREXPOSURE TO LEAD MAY
    CAUSE LOSS OF APPETITE, FATIGUE, ANEMIA, DAMAGE TO KIDNEYS AND
    NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:CHRONIC FORMS OF LIVER, KIDNEY AND
    NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES, ECZEMA AND DERMATITIS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE/SKIN:FLUSH CONTACTED AREA WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR
    AT LEAST 15 MINUTES. REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING AND GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION. IF SWALLOWED, GIVE LARGE VOLUMES OF WATER. DO NOT INDUCE
    VOMI TING, OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION. INHALATION OF FUMES:REMOVE TO
    OPEN AREA AND CONSULT A PHYSICIAN. EYEWASH AND SHOWER STATIONS
    SHOULD BE AVAILABLE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:4.0(H2 GAS)
Upper Limits:74(FOR H2)
Extinguishing Media:NON-COMBUSTIBLE. FOR SURROUNDING FIRE USE WATER
    FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FIRE FIGHTING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND A
    FULL FACED SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EVACUATE AREA. COOL
    FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS WITH WATER SPRAY.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:COMBUSTION OR HEAT OF FIRE MAY PRODUCE
    HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS AND VAPORS. HYDROGEN & OXYGEN ARE
    PRODUCED IN THE CELLS, KEEP AWAY FROM FIRE & SPARKS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SPILL-DILUTE SPILL CAUTIOUSLY WITH FIVE TO SIX
    VOLUMES OF WATER AND GRADUALLY NEUTRALIZE WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE,
    SODA ASH OR LIME. WHEN EXPOSURE LEVEL IS NOT KNOWN, WEAR NIOSH
    APPROVED SELF-CONTAINED  RESPIRATOR.
Neutralizing Agent:SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA ASH OR LIME.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORAGE-STORE AWAY FROM REACTIVE
    MATERIALS, OPEN FLAMES AND SOURCES OF IGNITION.
Other Precautions:SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA ASH, SAND OR LIME SHOULD BE
    KEPT IN SAME GENERAL AREA FOR EMERGENCY USE. WASH HANDS THOROUGHLY
    AFTER HANDLING LEAD TERMINALS INORDER TO AVOID INGESTION OF
    LEAD/LEAD COMPOUNDS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS. ACID GAS
    RESPIRATOR REQUIRED WHEN PEL IS EXCEEDED OR EMPLOYEE WITNESSES
    RESPIRATORY IRRITATION.
Ventilation:WHEN PEL IS EXCEEDED LOCAL EXHAUST IS PREFERRED. USE
    ADEQUATE VENTILATION TO MAINTAIN EXPOSURE BELOW PEL.
Protective Gloves:ACID RESISTANT
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES/FACE SHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:ACID-RESISTANT APRONS, BOOTS AND PROTECTIVE
    CLOTHING.
Work Hygienic Practices:GOOD PERSONAL HYGIENE AND WORK PRACTICES ARE
