=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE: SULFURIC ACID IS SEVERELY
    IRRITATING TO CORROSIVE TO BODY TISSUES. LEAD IS IS TOXIC. 
    CHRONIC: SULFURIC ACID MAY CAUSE RESPIRATORY IRRITATION AND EROSION
    OF TOOTH ENAMEL. LEAD MAY CAUSE ANEMIA,  NEUROPATHY, KIDNEY DAMAGE,
    REPRODUCTIVECHANGES.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:LEAD AND ARSENIC ARE LISTED. SEE
    INDIVIDUAL REPORT FOR DETAILS.
Effects of Overexposure:EYE:SEVERE IRRITATION, BURNS, PAIN. SKIN:SEVERE
    IRRITATION, BURNS, ULCERATION. INHALED: RESPIRATORY IRRITATION,
    SEVERE WITH SULFURIC ACID, LESS SO WITH LEAD FUME. INGESTED:
    SULFURIC ACID CAUSES SEVERE  IRRITATION, BURNS TO G/I SYSTEM. LEAD
    CAUSES ABDOMINAL PAIN, NAUSEA, VOMITING, DIARRHEA LEADING TO
    SYSTEMIC TOXICITY.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING PULMONARY
    DISEASE DERMATITIS MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK WITH SULFURIC ACID.
    PEOPLE WITH SOME FORMS OF KIDNEY, LIVER OR NEUROLOGICAL DISEASES
    MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FROM LEAD.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR 15 MINUTES.
    GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING. WASH
    WITH PLENTY OF WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. GET MEDICAL ADVICE. INHALED:
    REMOVE FRO M EXPOSURE. LEAD; RINSE MOUTH & THROAT.BOTH; SEE DOCTOR.
    INGESTION:H*2SO*4; DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GIVE LARGE QUANTITY
    WATER . BOTH: CONSULT A PHYSICIAN IMMEDIATELY.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:4.1 (H*2)
Upper Limits:74.2 (H*2)
Extinguishing Media:CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL OR HALOGEN
Fire Fighting Procedures:IF BATTERY ON CHARGE, SHUT OFF POWER. WEAR
    POSITIVE PRESSURE SCBA. WATER ADDED TO ELECTROLYTE GENERATES HEAT
    CAUSING SPATTER. WEAR ACID-RESISTANT CLOTHING.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:WHEN BEING CHARGED THIS BATTERY GENERATES
    HYDROGEN GAS WHICH MAY FORM EXPLOSIVE MIXTURES WITH AIR. KEEP ALL
    SOURCES OF IGNITION AWAY FROM BATTERIES.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:STOP FLOW OF MATERIAL. CONTAIN & ABSORB WITH
    SAND, EARTH, OTHER NON COMBUSTABLE. CAREFULLY NEUTRALIZE. WEAR
    PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. DO NOT ALLOW TO ENTER SEWER UNTIL NEUTRALIZED.
Neutralizing Agent:J.T.BAKER'S NEUTRASORB (R) OR TEAM 'LOW NA+' ACID
    NEUTRALIZERS ARE RECOMMENDED.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE COOL, DRY, WELL VENTILATED AREA
    WITH IMPERVIOUS SURFACES AND CONTAINMENT FOR ELECTROLYTE SPILLS.
    STORE INSIDE AND SEPARATE FROM INCOMPATABLES.
Other Precautions:**STORE AND HANDLE ONLY IN AAREA WITH ADEQUATE WATER
    SUPPLY AND SPILL CONTROL AVOID DAMAGE TO CONTAINERS, KEEP AWAY FROM
    FIRE, HEAT, SPARKS.  **FOLLOW MANUFACTURER'S INSTRUCTION FOR
    INSTALLATION AND S ERVICE.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE REQUIRED UNDER NORMAL CIRCUMSTANCES. USE
    NIOSH APPROVED RESPIRATOR IF SULFURIC ACID MIST CONCENTRATION
    EXCEEDS PEL.
Ventilation:USE ACID RESISTANT MECHANICAL (GENERAL) OR LOCAL EXHAUST
    VENTILATION TO MEET PEL REQUIREMENTS.
Protective Gloves:ELBOW LENGTH RUBBER OR PLASTIC GLOVES
Eye Protection:SAFETY GOGGLES WITH OPTIONAL FACE SHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH STATION AND SAFETY SHOWER.
    INDUSTRIAL-TYPE WORK CLOTHING AND APRON AS REQUIRED.
Work Hygienic Practices:HANDLE	BATTERIES CAUTIOUSLY TO AVOID SPILLS.
