    CONTACT WITH EYES AND SKIN CAUSES IRRITATION AND SKIN BURNS.
    SULFURIC ACID IS A CORROSI VE CHEMICAL.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PULMONARY EDEMA, BRONCHITIS,
    EMPHYSEMA, DENTAL EROSION AND TRACHEOBRONCHITIS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SKIN: FLUSH CONTACTED AREA W/LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR AT
    LEAST 15 MINUTES. REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & OBTAIN MEDICAL
    ATTENTION. EYES: IMMEDIATELY FLUSH W/POTABLE WATER FOR A MINIMUM OF
    15 MIN, S EEK ASSISTANCE FROM MD . INGEST: GIVE LARGE VOLUMES OF
    WATER. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING, OBTAIN MEDICAL TREATMENT. INHAL:
    REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. SUPPORT BRTHG (GIVE O2/ARTF RESP) .

Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HYDROGEN GAS, WHICH MAY EXPLODE IF
    IGNITED, IS PRDCED BY THIS BATTERY, ESPECIALLY WHEN CHARGING. USE
    ADEQ VENT/AVOID OPEN FLAMES/SPARKS/OTHER SOURCES OF IGNIT.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SULFURIC ACID: DILUTE SPILL CAUTIOUSLY W/ FIVE
    TO SIX VOLUMES OF WATER & GRADUALLY NEUTRALIZE W/SODIUM
    BICARBONATE, SODA ASH OR LIME. WHEN EXPOSURE LEVEL IS NOT KNOWN,
    WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED POSITIV E PRESSURE SCBA.
Neutralizing Agent:SEE SPILL/RELEASE PROCEDURES.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE AWAY FROM REACTIVE MATERIAL.
Other Precautions:SODIUM BICARBONATE, SODA ASH, SAND OR LIME SHOULD BE
    KEPT IN SAME GENERAL AREA FOR EMERGENCY USE. IF BATTERY CASE IS
    BROKEN, AVOID DIRECT CONTACT WITH INTERNAL COMPONENTS.
