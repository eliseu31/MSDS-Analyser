Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:HIGH VAPOR CONCENTRATION CAN INDUCE
    NAUSEA, HEADACHE, SMARTING OF EYES, AND IRRITATION OF RESPIRATORY
    SYSTEM. LIQUID CONTACT WITH EYES CAN CAUSE IRRITATION & POSSIBLE
    CORNEAL DAMAGE.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT
Effects of Overexposure:SEE HEALTH HAZARDS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:SORES OR OPEN WOUNDS OF THE SKIN.
    MAY CAUSE ALLERGIC REACTION IN PEOPLE WITH SENSITIVITY TO ACRYLICS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHAL: MOVE TO FRESH AIR. GIVE OXYGEN OR ARTIFICIAL
    RESPIRATION AS REQUIRED. INGEST: INDUCE VOMITING & CONSULT MD
    IMMEDIATELY. EYE: FLUSH PROMPTLY W/COPIOUS AMOUNT OF WATER FOR A
    MINIMUM OF 15 MIN & C ONSULT MD IF IRRITATION IS APPARENT. SKIN:
    WASH W/SOAP & WATER.

Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE INEFFECTIVE UNLESS USED AS A FINE
    SPRAY/FOG. USE WATERSPRAY TO COOL FIRE EXPOSED CONTRS OF
    METHYLMETHACRYLATE. WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPRVD (SUPP DATA)
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS MAY TRAVEL TO SOURCE OF
    IGNITION/FLASH BACK. AVOID IGNITION SOURCE/EXCESSIVE TEMPS. HEAT
    CAN INDUCE POLYMERIZATION W/RAPID RELEASE OF ENERGY. (SUPP DATA)

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ELIMINATE IGNITION SOURCES. AVOID BREATHING
    VAPORS. DIKE & ABSORB SPILL W/INERT MATL (SAND/SODA ASH,
    VERTICULITE, ETC.) AND TRANSFER TO CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL, USE
    NON-SPARKING TOOLS. REMOVE SATURATE D CLTHG & WASH AFFECTED SKIN
    AREAS W/SOAP & WATER.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE AT AMBIENT TEMPERATURES OUT OF
    DIRECT SUNLIGHT-ADVISABLE TO USE OLDEST MATERIALS FIRST. USE
    ADEQUATE VENTILATION.
Other Precautions:AVOID REPEATED BREATHING & CONTACT W/SKIN. KEEP
    CONTRS CLOSED AND AWAY FROM HEAT. KEEP AWAY FROM SPARKS AND OPEN
    FLAME.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING
    APPARATUS DURING HIGH VAPOR CONCENTRATION.
