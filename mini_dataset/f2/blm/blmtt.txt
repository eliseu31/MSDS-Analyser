=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:100,000 PPM/1 MIN HUMAN INHALATION LCLO
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:NO  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:PRODUCT CAN CAUSE ASPHYXIATION BY
    DISPLACING OXYGEN. AT HIGH CONCENTRATIONS PARALYSIS OF THE
    RESPIRATORY CONTROL CENTER OF THE NERVOUS SYSTEM MAY OCCUR.
    UNCONSCIOUSNESS MAY OCCUR.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:PRODUCT IS NOT CURRENTLY CLASSIFIED AS
    CARCINOGENIC BY NTP, IARC OR OSHA.
Effects of Overexposure:LOW CONCENTRATIONS MAY INCLUDE HEADACHE,
    DIZZINESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, MUSCULAR WEAKNESS, DROWSINESS,
    RINGING IN EARS. HIGH CONCENTRATIONS MAY PRODUCE A FAINT ACIDIC
    TASTE AND PARALYSIS OF RESPIRATO RY SYSTEM. CONTACT WITH LIQUID OR
    SOLIDCARBON DIOXIDE MAY CAUSE FROSTBITE AND FREEZE BURNS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:IN CASE OF CONTACT WITH LIQUID OR SOLID, PROMPTLY FLUSH AREAS
    WITH TEPID WATER. DO NOT APPLY DIRECT HEAT. LOOSELY APPLY DRY
    STERILE BULKY DRESSINGS TO PROTECT AREA FROM INFECTION. GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTIO N. IN CASE OF INHALATION, REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. QUICKLY
    RESTORE AND/OR SUPPORT BREATHING. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. CAUTION!
    WOULD-BE RESCUERS NEED TO BE CONCERNED WITH THEIR OWN SAFETY DURNIG
    RESCUE.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Lower Limits:NONE
Upper Limits:NONE
Extinguishing Media:USE EXTINGUISHING MEDIA APPROPRIATE FOR SURROUNDING
    FIRE. THIS MAATERIAL CAN BE USED AS AN EXTIGUISHING AGENT.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE USED TO INCREASE THE RATE OF
    EVAPORATION. CARBON DIOXIDE IS A FIRE EXTINGUISHING AGENT BUT MAY
    NOT BE EFFECTIVE ON CHEMICALS THAT SUPPLY OXYGEN.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:WHEN EXPOSED TO FIRE, CONTAINERS MAY
    RUPTURE VIOLENTLY. FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE SELF-CONTAINED
    BREATHING APPARATUS AND WEAR FULLY PROTECTIVE CLOTHING.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:NOTIFY SAFETY PERSONNEL OF MAJOR LEAKS OR
    SPILLS. EVACUATE AREA UNTIL VENTILATION CAN RESTORE A SAFE OXYGEN
    LEVEL. EMRGENCY PERSONNEL NEED SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING EQUIPMENT
    AND PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AG AINST CONTACT WITH SOLID MATERIAL.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:HANDLING, STORAGE, AND UTILIZATION OF
    COMPRESSED-GAS CYLINDERS MUST BE IN ACCORDANCE WITH 29 CFR
    1910.101(6). DO NOT STORE THEN IN ENCLOSED AREAS.
Other Precautions:DO NOT PUT DRY ICE IN A CLOSED CONTAINER WHERE
    EVOLVED GAS CANNOT ESCAPE. USE AN UNSEALED, INSULATED STORAGE CHEST
    OR CONTAINER FOR DRY ICE. STORE IN A COOL, DARK, WELL-VENTILATED
    AREA AWAY FROM SOURC ES OF HEAT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:PROVIDE AIR-SUPPLIED OR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING
    EQUIPMENT FOR EMERGENCY OR NONROUTINE SITUATIONS WHERE THE LEVEL OF
    CARBON DIOXIDE IS EXCESSIVE.
Ventilation:PROVIDE ADEQUATE GENERAL AND LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION TO
    PREVENT WORKPLACE ATMOSPHERES FROM BECOMING OXYGEN DEFICIENT.
Protective Gloves:INSULATED GLOVES FOR SOLID/LIQUID
Eye Protection:SAFETY GLASSES
Other Protective Equipment:USE A SAFETY LINE AND STANDBY WORKER WHEN
    ENTERING CARBON-DIOXIDE ENRICHED AREA. SAFETY SHOES ARE
    RECOMMENDED.
Work Hygienic Practices:CONTACT LENSES POSE A SPECIAL HAZARD; SOFT
    LENSES MAY ABSORB IRRITANTS AND ALL LENSES CONCENTRATE IRRITANTS.
Supplemental Safety and Health
OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURES MAY OCCUR IN SUCH PLACES AS MINES, SILOS, VATS,
    SHIPS HOLDS, WHERE FERMENTATION PROCESSES MAY DEPLETE OXYGEN WITH
    CARBON DIOXIDE.
