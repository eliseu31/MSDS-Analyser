Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FIRE FIGHTING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND A
    FULL FACED SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EVACUATE AREA. COOL
    FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS WITH WATER SPRAY.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND MAY
    TRAVEL A CONSIDERABLE DISTANCE TO A SOURCE OF IGNITION AND FLASH
    BACK. VAPOR-AIR MIXTURES ARE EXPLOSIVE ABOVE FLASH POINT.

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORAGE-STORE IN COOL,DRY,WELL
    VENTILATED AREA AWAY FROM SOURCES OF IGNITION.
Other Precautions:STORE AWAY FROM INCOMPATIBLE SUBSTANCES. MAY BE
    IGNITED BY SPARKS, STATIC ELECTRICITY OR FLAMES. CONTAINER MAY
    EXPLODE IN HEAT OF FIRE. VAPOR EXPLOSION HAZARD INDOORS, OUTDOORS
    OR IN SEWERS. RUN-OFF T O SEWER MAY CREATE FIRE/EXPLOSION HAZARD

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF VENTILATION DOES NOT MAINTAIN INHALATION
    EXPOSURES BELOW PEL(TLV), USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED SELF-CONTAINED
    BREATHING APPARATUS OR A SUPPLIED-AIR RESPIRATOR WITH FULL
    FACEPIECE OPERATED IN POSITIVE P RESSURE MODE.
Ventilation:MECHANICAL (GENERAL) ROOM VENTILATION AND LOCAL EXHAUST
    BOTH REQUIRED.
Protective Gloves:NEOPRENE OR RUBBER
Eye Protection:SPLASH-PROOF CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH STATION AND SAFETY SHOWER.
    INDUSTRIAL-TYPE WORK CLOTHING, APRON, AND BOOTS IF SPILLS OR
    SPLASHING CAN OCCUR.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH THOROUGHLY WITH SOAP AND WATER AFTER
