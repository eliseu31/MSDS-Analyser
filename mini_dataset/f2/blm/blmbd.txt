Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: CONTACT W/LIQUID MAY CAUSE BLINDNESS.
    INGEST: CAN CAUSE IRRITATION & SEVERE CORROSIVE BURNS TO MOUTH,
    THROAT & STOMACH. CHRONIC: PROLONGED EXPOSURE TO STRONG
    CONCENTRATIONS OF NITRIC ACID VA PORS MAY CAUSE EROSION TO THE
    TEETH.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SKIN/EYE CONTACT: FLUSH AREAS W/PLENTY OF LUKEWARM GENTLY
    FLOWING WATER FOR A MINIMUM OF 15 MINUTES. INHAL: MOVE TO FRESH
    AIR. IF BREATHING HAS STOPPED, ADMINISTER ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.
    EFFECTS OF I NHALATION MAY BE DELAYED. INGEST: GIVE WATER OR MILK
    TO DILUTE ACID. DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. CONTACT MD &/OR THE NEAREST
    POIS CTL CTR FOR ALL EXPOSURES EXCEPT IN MINOR CASES OF EXPOSURE TO
    THE SKIN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NOT APPROPRIATE
Extinguishing Media:NITRIC ACID IS NON-FLAMM BUT A STRONG OXIDIZER &
    IGNITES ORGANIC MATLS. USE EXTING MATL SUITABLE FOR SURROUNDING
    FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WHEN USING WATER ON A FIRE INVOLVING NITRIC
    ACID, THE ACID WILL REACT W/THE WATER OR STEAM TO PRODUCE
    HEAT/CORROSIVE & TOXIC FUMES. WEAR NIOSH/MSHA (SUPP DATA)
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:WATER ADDED TO ACID CAN CAUSE VIOLENT
    SPLATTERING. HAZARDOUS COMBUSTION PRODUCT: TOXIC NOX.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:DILUTE SMALL SPILLS CAUTIOUSLY W/PLENTY OF
    WATER. NEUTRALIZE RESIDUE W/ALKALI SUCH AS SODA ASH OR LIMESTONE.
    ADEQUATE VENTILATION IS REQUIRED TO ELIMINATE ANY NOX RELEASED.
    LARGE SPILLS SHOULD BE DIKE D FOR RECOVERY OR CONTROLLED
    NEUTRALIZATION.
Neutralizing Agent:SEE SPILL/RELEASE PROCEDURES.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. STORE IN
    COOL, WELL VENTILATED PROPERLY DRAINED AREA AWAY FROM DIRECT
    SUNLIGHT; STORE AWAY FROM INCOMPATIBLE MATERIALS.
Other Precautions:SEVERE IRRITANT. CORROSIVE.
