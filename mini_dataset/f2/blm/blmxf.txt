=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ACUTE:INHALATION OF ACID VAPORS MAY
    CAUSE SEVERE IRRITATION OR BURNS OF THE RESPIRATORY SYSTEM,
    PULMONARY EDEMA, OR LUNG INFLAMMATION. MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS TO
    SKIN OR EYES. INGESTION MAY CAUSE SEVER E BURNS TO MOUTH, THROAT,
    AND STOMACH. MAY AFFECT KIDNEY FUNCTION. CHRONIC:MAY DAMAGE
    LUNGS,TEETH EROSION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:ARSENIC IS LISTED BY IARC, NTP, & OSHA
    AS A CARCINOGEN. LEAD IS CONSIDERED A PROBABLE CARCINOGEN.
Effects of Overexposure:ACID:SEVERE IRRITATION OR BURNS TO EYES, NOSE
    AND THROAT. DENTAL EROSION, NAUSEA AND VOMITING. LEAD:STOMACH
    CRAMPS, LOSS OF APPETITE, MUSCULAR ACHES AND WEAKNESS, SLEEP
    DISTURBANCES AND IRRITABILITY,  ANEMIA AND NERVE DAMAGE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PULMONARY CONDITIONS, SKIN
    DISEASES, LIVER, KIDNEY AND NEUROLOGIC DISEASES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESUSCITATE IF NOT BREATHING.
    GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF WATER
    FOR 15 MINUTES HOLDING EYELIDS OPEN. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. SKIN:

Upper Limits:74.2(FOR H2)
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY
    CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:IF ON CHARGE, SHUT OFF POWER. WATER APPLIED TO
    ACID GENERATES HEAT AND CAUSES IT TO SPLATTER. WEAR ACID RESISTANT
    CLOTHING.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:WILL GENERATE HYDROGEN ON OVERCHARGE. MAY
    EXPLODE IN FIRE AND PRODUCE HAZARDOUS FUMES AND OXIDE OF SULFUR
    GASES.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS AND
    FULL PROTECTIVE CLOTHING. STOP LEAK IF YOU CAN DO SO WITHOUT RISK.
    DO NOT USE WATER. NEUTRALIZE SPILL AND/OR WASHINGS WITH SODA ASH OR
    LIME. WITH CLEAN SHOV EL, PLACE MATERIAL INTO CLEAN, DRY CONTAINER.
