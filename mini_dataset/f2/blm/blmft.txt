=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:NO  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EYE: SOLID/DUSTS MAY CAUSE
    IRRIT/CORNEAL INJ DUE TO MECH ACTION. THERMAL DEGRADATION OF RESIN
    MAY GENERATE HYDROGEN CHLORIDE GAS AT CONCENTRATIONS WHICH MAY
    CAUSE EYE & RESP IRRIT. SKIN: ESSENTIALLY N ON-IRRITATING TO SKIN.
    MECHANICAL INJ ONLY. SKIN ABSORP: SKIN ABSORP IS UNLIKELY DUE TO
    PHYS (SEE EFTS OF OVEREXP)
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NOT RELEVANT.
Effects of Overexposure:HLTH HAZ: PROPERTIES. INGEST: SINGLE DOSE ORAL
    LD50 HAS NOT BEEN DETERMINED. SINGLE DOSE ORAL TOXICITY IS BELIEVED
    TO BE VERY LOW. NO HAZARDS ANTICIPATED FROM SWALLOWING SMALL
    AMOUNTS INCIDENTAL TO NO RMAL HNDLG OPERATIONS. INHAL: DUST MAY
    CAUSE IRRIT TO UPPER RESP TRACT. THERMAL DEGRADATION OF RESIN MAY
    (SUPP DATA)
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: IRRIGATE IMMEDIATELY WITH WATER FOR AT LEAST 15
    MINUTES. SKIN: WASH OFF IN FLOWING WATER OR SHOWER. INGESTION: NO
    ADVERSE EFFECTS ANTICIPATED BY THIS ROUTE OF EXPOSURE INCIDENTAL TO
    PROPER INDUS TRIAL HANDLING. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IF
    EFFECTS OCCUR. SUPPORT BREATHING(GIVE O2/ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION).
    CONSULT A PHYSICIAN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, DRY CHEMICAL, AND FOAM.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED POSITIVE PRESSURE
    SCBA & FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT  TO PROTECT AGAINST HYDROGEN
    CHLORIDE IF RESIN IS EXPOSED TO FIRE CONDITIONS.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:HYDROGEN CHLORIDE IS RELEASED IF RESIN IS
    EXPOSED TO FIRE CONDITIONS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SWEEP UP AND DISPOSE OF IN ACCORDANCE WITH
    APPLICABLE LOCAL, STATE AND FEDERAL REGULATIONS.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:RESIN IS MOST FREQUENTLY USED IN
    COMBINATION W/FLAM SOLV.FAMILIARITY W/FLAM SOLV IS REQD.IF
    UNFAMILIAR,OBTAIN INFO ON HLTH & SAFE HNDLG FROM SOLV SUP.
Other Precautions:TRANSFERRING OF RESIN FROM CNTNR CAUSES STATIC
    BUILDUP. ANY TRANSFERRING NEAR FLAM SOLV REQS GROUNDING OF ALL
    CNTNRS & EQUIP. RESIN DEGRADES, EVOLVING HYDROGEN CHLORIDE VERY
    SLOWLY ABOVE AMBIENT TEMP.	EFFORTS SHD BE TAKEN TO KEEP (SUP DAT)

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:FOR MOST CONDITIONS, NO RESP PROTECTION SHOULD
    BE NEEDED; HOWEVER, IF THERMAL DEGRADATION OCCURS WITHOUT
    SUFFICIENT VENTILATION, USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED AIR-PURIFYING RESP.
    IN DUSTY ATMOSPHERES, USE A  NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED DUST RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:GOOD GEN VENT SHD BE SUFFICIENT FOR MOST CONDITIONS. LOCAL
    EXHAUST VENTILATION MAY BE NECESSARY FOR SOME OPERATIONS.
Protective Gloves:IMPERVIOUS GLOVES .
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL WORKERS GOGGLES .
Other Protective Equipment:CLEAN BODY-COVERING CLOTHING.
Work Hygienic Practices:NONE SPECIFIED BY MANUFACTURER.
Supplemental Safety and Health
EFTS OF OVEREXP: GENERATE HYDROGEN CHLORIDE GAS AT CONC WHICH MAY CAUSE
    EYE & RESP IRRIT. SYS & OTHER EFTS: RPTD EXPOS TO DUSTS OF MATL ARE
    NOT ANTICIPATED TO RSLT IN SYS TOXICITY/PERM LUNG INJ; HOWEV ER,
    EXCESSIVE EXPOS MAY CAUSE LESS SEVERE RESP EFTS. OTHER PREC: RESIN
    AS COOL AS POS. CARTON EMBRITTLEMENT (ING 2)
