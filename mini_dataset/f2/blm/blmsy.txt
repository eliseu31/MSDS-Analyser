=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:ORAL LD50 (RAT) IS NOT RELEVANT
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:NO
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Effects of Overexposure:PHYSICAL CONTACT WITH LIQUEFIED/SOLID CARBON
    DIOXIDE CAN CAUSE FROSTBITE OR FREEZE BURNS.INHALATION OF VAPOR IN
    CONCENTRATION OF 3-5% BY VOLUME IN AIR CAUSES INCREASED RESPIRATION
    & HEADACHE;8-15% CAU SES HEADACHE,NAUSEA,VOMITING &
    UNCONSCIOUSNESS.HIGHER CONCENTRATION MAY LEAD TO COMA & DEATH.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.INHALATION:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR.GIVE
    CPR/OXYGEN IF NEEDED.EYES:IMMEDIATELY FLUSH WITH PLENTY OF TEPID
    WATER/STERILE SALINE.SKIN:FLUSH WITH LUKEWARM WATER.DO NOT USE HOT
    WATER.PROM PT MEDICAL ATTENTION IS MANDATORY IN ALL CASES OF
    OVEREXPOSURE TO CO2.RESCUE PERSONNEL SHOULD BE EQUIPPED WITH SELF
    CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Extinguishing Media:MEDIA APPROPRIATE FOR SURROUNDING FIRE.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FIRE FIGHTING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND A
    FULL FACED SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EVACUATE AREA. COOL
    FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS WITH WATER SPRAY.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CO2 IS A NON-FLAMMABLE INERT GAS.
    HOWEVER, EXPOSURE TO FIRE OR SEVERE OVERHEATING CAN CAUSE CARBON
    DIOXIDE CYLINDERS TO BURST.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:EVACUATE ALL PERSONNEL FROM AREA. USE
    APPROPRIATE PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. PROVIDE VENTILATION TO AREA AND
    AVOID CONTACT WITH SOLID OR LIQUID AND EXCESSIVE INHALATION OF
    VAPOR. VALVE OFF CARBON DIOXIDE S UPPLY FROM LEAKING OR BROKEN
    COMPONENTS.
Neutralizing Agent:NOT APPLICABLE.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL,DRY,VENTILATED
    PLACE.DO NOT INSTALL STORAGE VESSELS IN SUB SURFACE,CLOSED AREA OR
    NEAR HEAT/FLAME.
Other Precautions:AVOID PROLONGED OR REPEATED BREATHING OF VAPOR. AVOID
    CONTACT WITH EYES OR SKIN. USE WITH ADEQUATE VENTILATION. WASH
    THOROUGHLY AFTER HANDLING.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:POSITIVE PRESSURE AIR LINE WITH FULL FACE PIECE
    AND ESCAPE AIR SUPPLY OR SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS SHOULD
    BE AVAILABLE FOR EMERGENCY USE.
Ventilation:SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT ACCUMULATION ABOVE TLV. LOCAL EXHAUST
    SHOULD BE LOCATED NEAR THE FLOOR.
