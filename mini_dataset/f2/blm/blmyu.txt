=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:Adverse effects on human health are
    not expected from Simple Green
Automotive Cleaner, based upon twenty years of use of Simple Green
®
without reported adverse health incidence in diverse population
groups, including extensive use by inmates of U.S. Federal prisons in
    cleaning operations.
Simple Green
®
Automotive Cleaner is a mild eye irritant; mucous membranes may become
    irritated by concentrate-mist. Simple
Green
®
Automotive Cleaner is not likely to irritate the skin in the majority
    of users. Repeated daily application to the skin without rinsing,
or continuous contact of Simple Green
®
Automotive Cleaner on the skin may lead to temporary, but reversible,
    irritation.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:Mild eye irritant, non-mutagenic and
    non-carcinogenic. None of the ingredients in Simple Green®
    Automotive
Cleaner are regulated or listed as potential cancer agents by Federal
    OSHA, NTP, or IARC.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:No aggravation of existing medical
    conditions is expected; dermal-sensitive users
may react to dermal contact by Simple Green
®
Automotive Cleaner.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:Eye contact: Reddening may develop. Immediately rinse the eye
    with large quantities of cool water; continue 10-15
minutes or until the material has been removed; be sure to remove
    contact lenses, if present, and to lift
upper and lower lids during rinsing. Get medical attention if
    irritation persists.
Skin contact: Minimal effects, if any; rinse skin with water, rinse
    shoes and launder clothing before reuse. Reversible
reddening may occur in some dermal-sensitive users; thoroughly rinse
    area and get medical attention if
reaction persists.
Swallowing: Essentially non-toxic. Give several glasses of water to
    dilute; do not induce vomiting. If stomach upset
occurs, consult physician.
Inhalation: Non-toxic. Exposures to concentrate-mist may cause mild
    irritation of nasal passages or throat;
remove to fresh air. Get medical attention if irritation persists.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:Not flammable.
Autoignition Temp:Autoignition Temp Text:Not flammable.
Extinguishing Media:Not flammable/nonexplosive. No special procedures
    required.
Fire Fighting Procedures:None required.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:Simple Green
Automotive Cleaner is stable, not flammable, and will not burn.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:Recover usable material by convenient method;
    residual may be removed by wipe or wet mop. If necessary,
    unrecoverable
material may be washed to drain with large quantities of water.

Other Precautions:

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:No special precautions required except during
    large-scale spray applications where spray
mist levels are high.
Ventilation:No special ventilation is required during use. Large-scale
    uses indoors should provide an increased rate of air exchange.
Protective Gloves:No special precautions required; rinse completely
    from skin after contact.
Eye Protection:Caution, including reasonable eye protection, should
    always be used to avoid eye
contact where splashing may occur.
Other Protective Equipment:No special requirements under normal use
    conditions.

===================  Toxicological Information	===================

Toxicological Information:The information and conclusions cited in this
    section are based on data and testing of Simple Green®. The data
    are
directly applicable to Simple Green® Automotive Cleaner because, except
    for the fragrance and dyes, it contains the
same ingredients as Simple Green®.
Nonhuman Toxicity
Acute Mortality Studies:Oral LD50 (rat): >5.0 g/kg body weight //
    Dermal LD50 (rabbit): >2.0 g/kg body weight
Dermal Irritation: Only mild, but reversible, irritation was found in a
    standard 72-hr test on rabbits. A value of 0.2
(non-irritating) was found on a scale of 8.
Eye Irritation: With or without rinsing with water, the irritation
    scores in rabbits at 24 hours did not exceed 15 (mild irritant)
on a scale of 110.
Subchronic dermal effects: No adverse effects, except reversible dermal
    irritation, were found in rabbits exposed to
Simple Green® (up to 2.0 g/kg/day for 13 weeks) applied to the skin of
    25 males and 25 females. Only female body weight
gain was affected. Detailed microscopic examination of all major
    tissues showed no adverse changes.
Fertility Assessment by Continuous Breeding: The Simple Green®
    formulation had no adverse effect on fertility and
reproduction in CD-1 mice with continuous administration for 18 weeks,
    and had no adverse effect on the reproductive
performance of their offspring.

=====================  Ecological Information  =====================

Ecological:Biodegradability:Like Simple Green®, Simple Green®
    Automotive Cleaner is readily decomposed by naturally occurring
    microorganisms. The
biological oxygen demand (BOD), as a percentage of the chemical oxygen
    demand (COD), after 4, 7, and 11 days was 56%,
60%, and 70%, respectively. Per OECD Closed Bottle Test, Simple Green®
    Automotive Cleaner meets OECD and EPA
recommendations for ready biodegradability.
In a standard biodegradation test with soils from three different
    countries, Butyl Cellosolve reached 50% degradation in 6 to
23 days, depending upon soil type, and exceeded the rate of degradation
    for glucose which was used as a control for
comparison.
Environmental Toxicity Information:Simple Green® Automotive Cleaner is
    considered practically non-toxic per EPA’s aquatic toxicity scale.

====================  Disposal Considerations  ====================

Waste Disposal Methods:Simple Green® Automotive Cleaner is fully water
    soluble and biodegradable and will not harm sewage-treatment
microorganisms if disposal by sewer or drain is necessary. Dispose of
    in accordance with all applicable local, state, and
federal laws.

===================  MSDS Transport Information  ===================

Transport Information:No special precautions are required. This product
    is non-hazardous for storage and transport according to the U.S.
Department of Transportation Regulations. Simple Green® Automotive
    Cleaner requires no special labeling or placarding
to meet U.S. Department of Transportation requirements.
UN Number: Not required
Dangerous Goods Class: Nonhazardous

=====================  Regulatory Information  =====================

SARA Title III Information:The Butyl Cellosolve in Simple Green®
    Automotive Cleaner is part of a chemical category (glycol ethers)
    regulated by the
Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (SARA, Title III,
    section 313); therefore, a reporting requirement

    Green® Automotive Cleaner contains no known EPA priority
    pollutants, heavy
metals, or chemicals listed under RCRA, CERCLA, or CWA. Analysis by
    TCLP (Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure)
according to RCRA revealed no toxic organic or inorganic constituents.
