=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:YES	 OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SULFURIC ACID IS A STRONG CORROSIVE.
    CONTACT CAN CAUSE SEVERE BURNS TO SKIN AND EYES. INGESTION WILL
    CAUSE GI TRACT BURNS. ACID CAN BE RELEASED IF CASE IS DAMAGED OR IF
    VENTS ARE TAMPERED WITH. EFFECT S OF LEAD ARE ACCUMULATIVE. IT
    AFFECTS THE KIDNEYS, REPRODUCTIVE, AND CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:IARC LIST LEAD AS A POSSIBLE CARCINOGEN
    TO HUMANS FOR WHICHH THERE IS INADEQUATE EVIDENCE.
Effects of Overexposure:ACID CONTACT MAY CAUSE SEVERE BURNS TO SKIN AND
    EYES. BREATHING OF MIST MAY PRODUCE NOSE AND THROAT IRRITATION AND
    RESPIRATORY DIFFICULTY. OVEREXPOSURE TO LEAD AFFECTS KIDNEYS,
    REPRODUCTIVE AND CNS. S YMPTOMS ARE ANEMIA, VOMITING,
    HEADACHE,STOMACH PAIN (LEAD COLIC), DIZZINESS, LOSS OF APPETITE,
    MUSCLE AND JOINT PAIN.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSON WITH PRE-EXISTING DISEASE
    INVOLVING THE EYES, SKIN, OR RESPIRATORY SYSTEM MAY BE AT INCREASED
    RISK FROM EXPOSURE TO INGREDIENTS IN THE BATTERIES.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH WITH LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER. GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING. FLUSH AREA WITH
    LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER. IF SYMPTOMS DEVELOP, GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.
    INHALATION: MOVE  TO FRESH AIR. IF ADVERSE SYMPTOMS DEVELOP, GET
    MEDICAL ATTENTION. INGESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING.IF
    CONSCIOUS,FLUSH MOUTH WITH WATER,GIVE MILK OR SODIUM BICARBONATE
    SOLUTION.GET MEDICAL ATTENTION.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Lower Limits:4.0 (H2 GAS)
Upper Limits:74 (H2 GAS)
Extinguishing Media:USE "APC" TYPE FIRE EXTINGUISHER FOR BATTERY FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR FIRE FIGHTING PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND A
    FULL FACED SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. EVACUATE AREA. COOL
    FIRE EXPOSED CONTAINERS WITH WATER SPRAY.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:COMBUSTION OR HEAT OF FIRE MAY PRODUCE
    HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS AND VAPORS. FLAMMABLE HYDROGEN GAS
    IS PRODUCED IN THE CELLS, KEEP AWAY IGNITION SOURCES.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:NEUTRALIZE ACID WITH SODIUM BICARBONATE
    (BAKING SODA), SODIUM CARBONATE (SODA ASH) OR CALCIUM OXIDE (LIME).
    FLUSH AREA WITH WATER, AND DISCARD TO SEWAGE SYSTEM. DO NOT ALLOW
    UNNEUTRALIZED ACID INTO SE WAGE SYSTEM.
Neutralizing Agent:SODIUM BICARBONATE(BAKING SODA), SODIUM
    CARBONATE(SODA ASH), CALCIUM OXIDE(LIME)

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE AWAY FROM REACTIVE MATERIALS,
    OPEN FLAMES AND SOURCES OF IGNITION. PROHIBIT SMOKING, SPARKS,
    FLAMES, ETC. FROM BATTERY CHARGING AREA.
Other Precautions:AVOID MIXING ACID WITH OTHER CHEMICALS. PREVENT SHORT
    CIRCUITING BATTERY TERMINALS. DO NOT REST TOOLS OR CABLES ON
    BATTERY. USE INSULATED TOOLS. FOLLOW INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND
    DIAGRAMS WHEN INST ALLING OR MAINTAINING BATTERY SYSTEMS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE UNDER NORMAL CONDITIONS. HEPA RESPIRATOR
    SHOULD BE WORN DURING BATTERY RECLAIM OPERATIONS, IF THE OSHA PEL
    IS EXCEEDED.
Ventilation:WHEN PEL IS EXCEEDED LOCAL EXHAUST IS PREFERRED. USE
    ADEQUATE VENTILATION TO MAINTAIN EXPOSURE BELOW PEL.
Protective Gloves:RUBBER GLOVES.
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES/FACE SHIELD.
Other Protective Equipment:PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT MUST BE WORN IF BATTERY
    IS CRACKED OR OTHERWISE DAMAGED.
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH AFTER HANDLING AND BEFORE EATING,
    DRINKING, OR SMOKING. LAUNDER CONTAMINATED CLOTHING BEFORE REUSE.
