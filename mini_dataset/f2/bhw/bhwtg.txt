=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:ORAL RAT LD50 IS 3826 MG/KG
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:PARA-DICHLOROBENZENE IS AN IRRITANT TO
    BODY TISSUES.  EXPOSURES BELOW THE TLV HAVE RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANT
    IRRITATION WITH PROLONGED/REPEATED EXPOSURE.  ACUTE CONTACT DOES

    PRODUCED LIVER AND/OR KIDNEY DAMAGE IN RATS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NTP CLASSES P-DICHLOROBENZENE AS
    "REASONABLY EXPECTED TO BE CARCINOGENIC" WHILE IARC CLASSES IT
    "INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE".
Effects of Overexposure:EYE:IRRITATION,PAIN  SKIN:IRRITATION,BURNING
    SENSATION	INHALED:RESPIRATORY IRRITATION	 INGESTED:G/I
    IRRITATION,MAY CAUSE LIVER AND/OR KIDNEY DAMAGE. METABOLISM OF
    PARADICHLOROBENZENE CAUSES THE URI NE TO CONTAIN
    2,5-DICHLOROPHENOL, WHICHHAS A CHARACTERISTIC ODOR.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:NONE GIVEN BY MANUMACTURER.
