=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:N/K 
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:LIQUID OXYGEN OR COLD GAS WILL FREEZE
    TISSUE AND CAN CAUSE SEVERE CRYOGENIC BURNS.PARTIAL PRESSURE OF
    OXYGEN IN EXCESS OF TWO ATMOSPHERES MAY CAUSE CNS EFFECTS.SEVERE
    HAZARDS MAY BE PRESENT WHEN CONF  AND IMPAIRED JUDGMENT LEAD TO
    OPERATIONAL ERRORS.INFANTS EXPOSED TO >35-40% OXYGEN MAY HAVE
    VISUAL IMPAIRMENT/BLINDNESS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:NONE
Effects of Overexposure:EYES/SKIN/INGESTION/INHALATION:CRYOGENIC
    BURNS,TISSUE FREEZING.BREATHING PURE OXYGEN:COUGH,CHEST PAIN IN
    8-24 HOURS.BREATHING 60% OXYGEN:COUGH,CHEST PAIN IN DAYS.BREATHING

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES/SKIN:IN CASE OF CONTACT WITH CRYOGENIC LIQUID OR COLD
    BOIL-OFF GAS,FLOOD OR SOAK FROZEN TISSUE IN TEPID WATER
    (105-115F,41-46C).DO NOT USE HOT WATER.IF BLISTERING OR DEEP TISSUE
    FREEZING OCCURS,S EE A PHYSICIAN PROMPTLY.INGESTION/INHALATION:N/K
    .

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Fire Fighting Procedures:OXYGEN IS NONFLAMMABLE,BUT SUPPORTS AND
    VIGOROUSLY ACCELERATES COMBUSTION OF FLAMMABLES.SHUT OFF SOURCES OF
    OXYGEN AND FIGHT LIKE CONVENTIONAL FIRES.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:NONFLAMMABLE,BUT SUPPORTS AND VIGOROUSLY
    ACCELERATES COMBUSTION.SOME MATERIALS WHICH ARE NONCOMBUSTIBLE IN
    AIR WILL BURN IN THE PRESENCE OF OXYGEN.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:PREVENT LIQUID OXYGEN FROM CONTACTING
    GREASE,OIL,ASPHALT OR COMBUSTIBLES.VENTILATE AREA AND FLUSH WITH
    LARGE AMOUNTS OF WATER.DO NOT ENTER AREA.EXPOSURE CAN INCREASE THE
    FLAMMABILITY OF CLOTHING.DO NO T SMOKE OR CONTACT IGNITION SOURCE
    AFTER EXPOSURE.
Neutralizing Agent:N/K 

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:PVNT CONT OF LIQ W/ SKIN/TRAPPING IN
    CLSD SYS.USE CLEAN,COMPATIBLE MATL IN PIPING/SYSTEMS.USE/STORE IN
    WELL-VENT AREA AWAY FROM HEAT & (SEE ING #4)
Other Precautions:OPEN VALVES SLOWLY.HANDLE CYL W/ CARE.USE A
    PRESS-REDUCING REGULATOR WHEN CONNECTING TO LOWER PRESS PIPING
    SYSTEMS.SECURE WHEN NOT IN USE.DO NOT HEAT DIRECTLY.USE A CHECK
    VALVE TO PVNT BACKFLOW.MOVE W /HAND TRUCK.DO NOT DRAG/ (SEE ING #6)
