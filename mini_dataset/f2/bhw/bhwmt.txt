=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING: MAY BE FATAL IF SWALLOWED.
    CAN CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITATION, NAUSEA, VOMITING. ASPIRATION
    OF METAL INTO LUNGS MAY CAUSE PNEUMONITIS. INHALED: WARNING VAPOR &
    SPRAY MIST IS HARMFUL, MA Y CAUSE LUNG DAMAGE. EYE & SKIN:
    IRRITATION, MAY CAUSE SKIN SENSITIZATION.
Effects of Overexposure:EXPOSURE TO DIISOCYANATES MAY RESULT IN
    RESPIRATORY SENSITIZATION. OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS WITH PERMANENT
    BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE. RESPIRATORY SENSITIVITY RESULTS IN
    ASTHMA-LIKE SYMPTOMS ON SUB SEQUENT EXPOSURE AT CONCENTRATIONS
    EVENBELOW THE TLV.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:SEE ABOVE

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION
    IMMEDIATELY. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR KEEP PERSON WARM &
    QUIET, GET MED ATTN. EYES: WASH WITH WATER, GET MED ATTN. SKIN:
    WASH AFFECTED  AREA, OBTAIN MED ATTN IF IRRITATION PERSISTS. NOTE
    TO PHYSICIAN:ANY TREATMENT THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR OVEREXPOSURE
    SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT THE CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS & THE CLINICAL
    CONDITIONS.
