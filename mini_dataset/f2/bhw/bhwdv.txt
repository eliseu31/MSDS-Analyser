Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:LIQUID IS SEVERELY IRRITATING TO BODY
    TISSUES. TOLUENE DIISOCYANATE MAY SENSITIZE SEVERE ALLERGIC
    REACTIONS SUCH AS A CHEMICAL ASTHMA. PEL FOR TDI IS BELOW THE ODOR
    THRESHOLD. SOLVENTS ARE ABSORBED BY  THE SKIN AND WITH CHRONIC
    OVEREXPOSUREMAY CAUSE PERMANENT CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE KNOWN
    AS PAINTERS SYNDROME.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:TOLUENE DIISOCYANATE IS LISTED BY NTP
    AND IARC.  SEE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS FOR DETAILS.
Effects of Overexposure:EYE: SEVERE IRRITATION. SKIN:IRRITATION,
    DERMATITIS, SENSITIZED DERMATITIS. INHALED:RESPIRATORY IRRITATION,
    FLU-LIKE SYMPTOMS, ASTHMA, SENSITIZING, NARCOSIS, LOSS OF APPETITE.
    INGESTED:G/I IRRITATION, HEADACHE,NAUSEA,VOMITING,DIARRHEA.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:SINCE TDI SENSITIZES DERMAL AND
    RESPIRATORY ALLERGYS, PEOPLE WITH ISOCYANATE SENSITIZATION, OR
    DERMATITIS, ASTHMA, AND OTHER SIMILAR DISORDERS SUCH AS EMPHYSEMA,
    ECZEMA, ETC. MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE:FLUSH W/WATER 15 MIN HOLD LIDS OPEN. SEE A DOCTOR.
    SKIN:REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING AND LAUNDER BEFORE REUSE. WASH
    WITH SOAP & WATER. INHALED:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESTORE BREATHING
    IF NECESSARY.  GET MEDICAL CARE AS ASTHMATIC SYMPTOMS MAY DEVELOP
    EITHER IMMEDIATELY OR BE DELAYED SEVERAL HOURS. INGESTED:DO NOT
    INDUCE VOMITING. GIVE MILK OR WATER TO DRINK IF CONSCIOUS. GET
    IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:PMCC
Flash Point:>260F,>127C
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL, OR WATER
    FOG.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FIRE OR EXCESSIVE HEAT MAY CAUSE
    PRODUCTION OF HIGHLY TOXIC DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS, AND/OR PRESSURES
    SUFFICIENT TO RUPTURE THE CONTAINERS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ALWAYS USE APPROPRIATE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE
    EQUIPMENT. COVER SPILL WITH SAWDUST,VERMICULITE,ETC.  ADD LIQUID
    DECONTAMINANT AND ALLOW TO SET FOR AT LEAST 10 MIN.  COLLECT
    MATERIAL IN OPEN CONTAINERS AND  ADD MORE DECONTAMINANT.
