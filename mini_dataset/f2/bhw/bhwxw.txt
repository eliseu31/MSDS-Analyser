=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:PRODUCT MAY BE IRRITATING TO BODY
    TISSUES. IT WILL DEFAT & DRY SKIN,POSSIBLY CAUSING DERMATITIS.
    EVAPORATION OF THE LIQUID IS MAY COOL TISSUES SUFFICIENTLY TO CAUSE
    FROSTBITE. VAPOR IS HEAVIER THAN AI R AND CAN CAUSE SUFFOCATION BY
    REDUCINGOXYGEN AVAILABLE FOR BREATHING.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:PERCHLOROETHYLENE AND METHYLENE CHLORIDE
    ARE LISTED AS CARCINOGENS.	SEE INDIVIDUAL REPORTS FOR DETAILS.
Effects of Overexposure:BREATHING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF VAPOR MAY
    CAUSE LIGHT-HEADEDNESS, GIDDINESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, AND MAY
    LEAD TO NARCOSIS, CARDIAC IRREGULARITIES, UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR DEATH.
    CONTACT WITH LIQUID CAN C AUSE DEFATTING OF TISSUE OR FROSTBITE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PRODUCT IS A DEFATTING AGENT AND
    CAN CAUSE DERMATITIS ON PROLONGED EXPOSURE. PERSONS WITH
    PRE-EXISTING SKIN DISORDERS MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE EFFECTS
    OF THIS MATERIAL.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE:FLUSH W/ WATER 15 MIN HOLD LIDS OPEN SEE A DOCTOR. 
    SKIN:WASH WITH SOAP & WATER. TREAT FOR FROST-BITE IF NEEDED. 
    INHALED:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESTORE BREATHING, AS NEEDED. DO NOT
    GIVE EPINEPHRINE  OR SIMILAR DRUGS. INGESTED:DO NOT INDUCE
    VOMITING. GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE.   IF IRRITATION PERSISTS,OR
    IS SEVERE,SEE A DOCTOR.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NON-FLAMMABLE
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER FOG, CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY
    CHEMICAL.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND COLLECT
    IN LOW AREAS, DEPRIVING THOSE ENTERING OF SUFFICIENT OXYGEN.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA. DO NOT FLUSH INTO SEWERS.
    COLLECT ON ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND TRANSFER TO STEEL DRUMS FOR
    RECOVERY OR DISPOSAL.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE BELOW 130 F, IN A CLEAN, DRY AND
    WELL-VENTILATED AREA OF LOW FIRE RISK. PROTECT CONTAINERS FROM
    PHYSICAL DAMAGE.
Other Precautions:APPLY ALL SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO EMPTY CONTAINERS AS
    THEY MAY CONTAIN PRODUCT RESIDUES/VAPORS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============
