=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:INHALATION: VAPOR IS HEAVIER THAN AIR
    AND CAN CAUSE SUFFOCATION BY REDUCING OXYGEN AVAILABLE FOR
    BREATHING. BREATHING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF VAPOR MAY CAUSE
    LIGHT-HEADEDNESS, GIDDINESS, SHORTNESS OF B REATH, AND MAY LEAD TO
    NARCOSIS, CARDIAC IRREGULARITIES, ULNCONSCIOUSNESS OF DEATH.
    SKIN/EYE: LIQUID CAN DEFAT TISSUE.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:DATA PER MSDS
Effects of Overexposure:BREATHING HIGH CONCENTRATIONS OF VAPOR MAY
    CAUSE LIGHT-HEADEDNESS, GIDDINESS, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, AND MAY
    LEAD TO NARCOSIS, CARDIAC IRREGULARITIES, UNCONSCIOUSNESS OR DEATH.
    LIQUID IS NOT CORROSIVE O R AN IRRITANT, BUT CAN CAUSE DEFATTING OF
    TISSUE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:SKIN DISEASE - FREON 113 IS A
    DEFATTING AGENT AND CAN CAUSE DERMATITIS ON PROLONGED EXPOSURE.
    PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING SKIN DISORDERS MAY BE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO
    THE EFFECTS OF THIS AGENT.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR, CALL A PHYSICIAN. IF NOT
    BREATHING, GIVE ARTIFICIAL RESPIRATION.IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT,
    GIVE OXYGEN. DO NOT GIVE EPINEPHRINE OR SIMILAR DRUGS. EYE: FLUSH
    WITH WATER . SKIN: FLUSH WITH WATER. IF IRRITATIONPRESISTS, GET
    MEDICAL ATTENTION. ORAL: GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY. DO NOT
    INDUCE VOMITING AS THE HAZARD OF ASPIRATING INTO THE LUNGS IS TOO
    GREAT.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Extinguishing Media:USE WATER FOG OR WATER SPRAY
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FIRE OR EXCESSIVE HEAT MAY CAUSE
    PRODUCTION OF HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:VENTILATE AREA. DO NOT FLUSH INTO SEWERS. DIKE
    SPILL. COLLECT ON ABSORBENT MATERIAL AND TRANSFER TO STEEL DRUMS
    FOR RECOVERY OR DISPOSAL. COMPLY WITH FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL
    REGULATIONS ON REPORTING  RELEASES.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A CLEAN, COOL, DRY AND
    WELL-VENTILATED AREA OF LOW FIRE RISK. PROTECT CONTAINERS FROM
    PHYSICAL DAMAGE AND KEEP CLOSED.
Other Precautions:AVOID BREATHING VAPOR, LIQUID CONTACT WITH EYES, SKIN
    OR CLOTHING. TANK-CLEANING PERSONNEL SHOULD USE ONLY FORMAL TANK
    ENTRY PROCEDURE BASED ON RECOGNIZED SAFETY PRINCIPLES. EMPTY
    CONTAINERS MAY CONTA IN PRODUCT RESIDUES/VAPORS.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NONE REQUIRED FOR ADEQUATELY VENTED WORK
    SITUATIONS. FOR ACCIDENTAL OR NON-VENTILATED SITUATIONS, USE A
    SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS OR SUPPLIED-AIR RESPIRATOR,
    APPROVED BY NIOSH.
Ventilation:PROVIDE LOCAL EXHAUST AT FILLING ZONES AND OTHER OPERATING
    SPACES WHERE LEAKAGE IS PROBABLE. MECHANICAL FOR OTHER.
Protective Gloves:BUTYL RUBBER, PVA OR NEOPRENE
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SPLASH GOGGLES
Other Protective Equipment:USE IMPERVIOUS CLOTHING IF THERE IS REPEATED
    OR PROLONGED CONTACT WITH LIQUID.
