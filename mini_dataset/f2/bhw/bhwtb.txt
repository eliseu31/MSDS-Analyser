    SEWERS, STREAMS, AND      GROUND MATERIAL W/SPILLED MATERIAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95F. STORE LARGE
    QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106		    DO
    NOT TAKE INTERNALLY, CLOSE CONTAINER AFTER USE.
Other Precautions:EMPTY CONTAINERS MUST NOT BE WASHED AND REUSED FOR
    ANY PURPOSE. CONTAINERS SHOULD BE GROUNDED AND BONDED TO THE
    RECEIVING CONTAINER. DO NOT WELD, BRAZE OR CUT  ON EMPTY
    CONTAINERS. NEVER USE PRESSURE  TO EMPTY, DRUM IS NOT A PRESSURE
    VESSEL.
