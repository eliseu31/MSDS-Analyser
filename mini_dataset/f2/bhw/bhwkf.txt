=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING MAY CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL
    IRRIT & CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS. INHALATION MAY CAUSE NOSE/THROAT
    IRRITATION & ACUTE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYS DEPRESSION. EYE & SKIN
    IRRITANT; HARMFUL AMTS CAN CAUSE SKIN  DEFATTING. OTHER EFFECTS:
    LIVER DAMAGE, PERM BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE & DEATH.
Effects of Overexposure:HEADACHES, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA, VOMITING,
    CONFUSION & SEVERE IRRITATION REACTION IF PRODUCT IS SWALLOWED,
    INHALED, ABSORBED THROUGH SKIN, OR GETS INTO EYES.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS, ACUTE CENTRAL
    NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION, LIVER DAMAGE, RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS,
    PERMANENT BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE & DEATH.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. CALL POISON CONTROL
    CENTER IMMEDIATELY.  INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR IMMEDIATELY.
    IF BREATHING STOPPED, GIVE CPR & KEEP WARM & QUIET. EYE: FLUSH WITH
    LARGE AMOU NTS OF WATER FOR 15 MIN LIFTING UPPER/LOWER LIDS
    CONTINUOUSLY. SKIN: REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING & WASH AFFECTED
    AREA WITH SOAP & WATER. GET MEDICAL ATTENTION IMMEDIATELY FOR ANY
    OF THESE CONDITIONS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:24F/-4C
Lower Limits:SEE INGRED.
Upper Limits:SEE INGRED.
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, OR DRY CHEMICAL FOR
    FLAMMABLE LIQUID FIRES. POLYMER FOAM IS PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WATER MAY BE INEFFECTIVE BUT USED TO COOL
    EXPOSED CONTAINERS & PREVENT PRESSURE BUILDUP &
    AUTO-IGNITE/EXPLOSION. IF WATER IS USED, FOG NOZZLES ARE
    PREFERABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS
    MAY CAUSE A HEALTH HAZARD.	SYMPTOMS MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY
    APPARENT.  OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:KEEP SPECTATORS AWAY. ELIMINATE ALL IGNITE
    SOURCES, CONTAIN SPILL WITH INERT MATERIAL, TRANSFER LIQUID TO
    COVERED METAL CONTAINERS FOR DISPOSAL. USE ONLY NON-SPARK TOOLS.
    PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF SEWE RS, STREAMS & GROUNDWATER.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 120 DEGREES F.
Other Precautions:EMPTY CONTAINERS SHOULD NOT BE WASHED OR REUSED FOR
    ANY PURPOSE AND SHOULD BE GROUNDED & BONDED TO RECEIVING CONTAINER.
    DO NOT WELD, BRAZE OR CUT ON EMPTY CONTAINER. NEVER USE PRESSURE TO
    EMPTY. DISPO SE AS HAZARDOUS WASTE, IGNITABLE, D001.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IN WELL VENTILATED AREAS, RESPIRATORY PROTECTION
    MAY NOT BE REQUIRED. IN RESTRICTED AREAS USE A NIOSH APPROVED
    CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE RESPIRATOR. FOR SPRAYING USE MECH PREFILTER. IN
    CONFINED AREAS USE NIO SH/MSHA APPR AIR SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:DILUTE & LOCAL EXHAUST RECOMMENDED TO CONTROL CONCENTRATE
    OF HAZARDOUS INGREDIENTS.
Protective Gloves:WEAR SOLVENT IMPERMEABLE GLOVES.
