=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

LD50 LC50 Mixture:ORAL LD50 (RAT) = 10,300 MG/KG
Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:YES    IARC:YES	  OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:PRODUCT IS IRRITATING TO BODY TISSUES,
    AND IS A CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSANT. CHRONIC OVER EXPOSURE
    MAY CAUSE DERMATITIS, LIVER AND/OR KIDNEY DAMAGE.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:1,4-DIOXANE IS LISTED AS A SUSPECTED
    CARCINOGEN BY IARC (2B) AND NTP.
Effects of Overexposure:HEADACHE, DIZZINESS, DROWSINESS, NAUSEA,
    TINGLING OR NUMBNESS OF THE EXTREMITIES, SENSES OF FULLNESS IN THE
    HEAD, SENSE OF WARMTH, STUPOR OR DULLNESS, LETHARGY AND
    DRUNKENNESS. VERY HIGH CONCENTRATION S MAY LEAD TO UNCONSCIOUSNESS
    OR EVEN DEATH IN CONFINED OR POORLY VENTILATED AREAS.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PERSONS WITH PRE-EXISTING
    RESPIRATORY AILMENTS MAY BE AT INCREASED RISK FROM EXPOSURE.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYE:FLUSH W/WATER 15 MIN, HOLD LIDS OPEN. SKIN:WASH WITH SOAP
    & WATER. REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING AND LAUNDER BEFORE REUSE.
    INHALED:REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. RESTORE BREATHING IF NECESSARY.
    INGESTED:DO N OT INDUCE VOMITING. GIVE 2 LARGE GLASSES OF MILK OR
    WATER AND GET IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE. GIVE NOTHING BY MOUTH IF
    UNCONSCIOUS. IF IRRITATION PERSISTS OR IS SEVERE,SEE A DOCTOR.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Lower Limits:6.5
Upper Limits:16
Extinguishing Media:USE CARBON DIOXIDE, FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL, OR WATER
    FOG.
Fire Fighting Procedures:FIRE FIGHTERS SHOULD USE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA &
    FULL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT WHEN FIGHTING CHEMICAL FIRE. USE WATER
    SPRAY TO COOL NEARBY CONTAINERS EXPOSED TO FIRE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FIRE OR EXCESSIVE HEAT MAY CAUSE
    PRODUCTION OF HAZARDOUS DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS. CLOSED CONTAINERS
    MAY EXPLODE. CONC. VAPORS WILL EXPLODE IF PROPERLY IGNITED.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:SMALL SPILL: WIPE UP WITH RAGS OR TOWELS;PLACE
    AN AN APPROPRIATE CONTAINER FOR DISPOSAL. VENTILATE AREA. RESIDUE
    WILL EVAPORATE QUICKLY. DO NOT FLUSH TO SEWER OR WATERWAY.
Neutralizing Agent:NONE

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:STORE IN A COOL, DRY, WELL-VENTILATED
    LOCATION, AWAY FROM ANY AREA WHERE THE FIRE HAZARD MAY BE ACUTE.
    KEEP CONTAINERS CLOSED WHEN NOT IN USE.
Other Precautions:VAPORS ARE HEAVIER THAN AIR AND WILL COLLECT IN LOW
    AREAS. THIS MATERIAL OR ITS VAPORS WHEN IN CONTACT WITH FLAMES, HOT
    GLOWING SURFACES OR ELECTRIC ARCS CAN DECOMPOSE TO FORM HYDROGEN
    CHLORIDE GAS AN D TRACES OF PHOSGENE.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:USE NIOSH/MSHA APPROVED AIR SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR
    OR RESPIRATOR FOR ORGANIC VAPOR IF EXPOSURE IS ABOVE THE TLV/PEL.
    IF EXPOSED ABOVE 1000 PPM USE ONLY A SUPPLIED AIR RESPIRATOR. SEE
    29 CFR 1910.134 FOR  REGULATIONS PERTAINING TO RESPIRATOR USE
Ventilation:NORMAL ROOM VENTILATION IS SUFFICIENT. SUPPLEMENT WITH
    LOCAL EXHAUST IF PEL/TLV IS EXCEEDED.
Protective Gloves:NEOPRENE, PVA GLOVES RECOMMENDED.
Eye Protection:CHEMICAL SAFETY GOGGLES & FACE SHIELD.
Other Protective Equipment:APRON AND WORK CLOTHING TO MINIMIZE
    EXPOSURE. EYE WASH STATION & SAFETY SHOWER RECOMMENDED.
Work Hygienic Practices:USE GOOD CHEMICAL HYGIENE PRACTICE. AVOID
    UNNECESSARY CONTACT.
