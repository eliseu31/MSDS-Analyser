=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:UNKNOWN	  IARC:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING MAY BE FATAL IF SWALLOWED.
    CAN CAUSE GASTROINTESTINAL/NAUSEA/VOMITINGASPIRATION OF MATERIAL
    INTO LUNG MAY CAUSE PNEUMONITES. INHALATION: NOSE OR THROAT
    IRRITATION. EYE: MAY CAUSE IRRITATION . SKIN: MAY CAUSE SKIN
    IRRITATION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:THE IARC CONSIDERS CRYSTALLINE SILICA TO
    HAVE LIMITED EVIDENCE IN HUMANS AND SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE IN
    EXPERIMENTAL ANIMALS
Effects of Overexposure:REPEATED EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA MAY
    CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS. OVEREXPOSURE TO TOLUENE MAY CAUSE LIVER
    DAMAGE. PROLONGED AND REPEATED OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLBVENTS WITH
    PERMANENT BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYST EM DAMAGE. INTENTIONAL MISUSE BY
    DELIBERATELY CONCENTRATING AND INHALING THE CONTENTS MAY BE HARMFUL
    OR FATAL.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS MAY BE
    AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GET MEDICAL ATTN
    IMMEDIATELY. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR KEEP WARM AND QUIET
    GET MED ATTN. EYE: WASH WITH WATER GET MEDATTN. SKIN:  WASH
    AFFECTED AREAQ OBTAIN  MED ATTN IF IRRITATION PERSISTS. NOTE
    TOPHYSICIAN: ANY TREATMENT THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR OVEREXPOSURE
    SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT THE CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS AND THE CLINICAL
    CONDITIONS.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:24F /-4.44C
Extinguishing Media:CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS. POLYMER FOAM IS
    PREFERRED FOR LARGE FIRES.
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR SELF-CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. WATER
    MAY BE USED TO COOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS TO PREVENT AUTO-IGNITION OR
    EXPLOSION. FOG NOZZLES PREFERRED IF WATER USED
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:OVEREXPOSURE TO DECOMPOSTION PRODUCTS MAY
    CAUSE A HEALTH HAZARD. SYMPTOMS MAY NOT BE IMMEDIATELY APPARENT.
    OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION. WARNING FLAMMABLE

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ELIMINATE ALL IGNITION SOURCES.KEEP SPECTATORS
    AWAY. DIKE WITH INERT MATERIAL. FOR RECOVERY OR DISPOAL USE METAL
    CONTAINERS. USE ONLY NON-SPARKING TOOLS. PREVENT CONTAMINATION OF
    SEWERS, STREAMS, GROU NDEATER WITH SPILLED MATERIAL OR USED
    ABSORBENT.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95F. STORE LARGE
    QUANTITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH OSHA 29CFR1910.106.
Other Precautions:DO NOT TAKE INTERNALLY. CLOSE CONTAINER AFTER EACH
    USE. DO NOT BREATHE SANDING  DUST. EMPTY CONTAINERS MUST NOT BE
    WASHED AND RE-USED FOR ANY PURPOSE. CONTAINERS GROUNDED AND BONDED
    TO THE RECEIVING C ONTAINER. DO NOT WELD/BRAZE/CUT ON CONT.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IN A WELL VENTILATED AREAS A RESPIRATORY MAY NOT
    BE NEEDED. RESTRICTED VENTILATION A NIOSH CHEMICAL CARTRIDGE
    RESPIRATOR MAY BE REQUIRED. CONFINED AREAS A NIOSH/MSHA AIR
    SUPPLIED RESPIRATOR.
Ventilation:GENERAL DILUTION AND LOCAL EXHAUST VENTILATION IN
    SUFFICIENTVOLUME AND PATTERN TO MAINTAIN CONCENTRATIONS.
Protective Gloves:IMPERMEABLE GLOVES
Eye Protection:SAFETY SPECTACLES
Other Protective Equipment:NOT LIKELY TO BE NEEDED.
Supplemental Safety and Health
DECOMPOSITION PRODUCTS: WELDING, BRAZING, OR TORCH CUTTING MATERIALS
    COATED WITH THIS PRODUCT MAY PRODUCE METAL OXIDES. OVEREXPOSURE TO
    THESE METAL OXIDES MAY RESULT IN METAL FUME FEVER. SYMPTOMS INCL
    UDE FLU-LIKE ILLNESS WITH FEVER/CHILLS/COUGH. AIR PURIFYING OR AIR
    RESPIRATOR MAY BE REQ DEPENDING ON LEVEL OF EXPOSURE
