=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:SWALLOWING-GASTROINTESTINAL
    IRRITATION, ASPIRATION OF MATERIAL INTO LUNG MAY CAUSE CHEMICAL
    PNEUMONITIS. EYE AND SKIN-IRRITATION. HIGN CONCENTRATIONS MAY CAUSE
    ACUTE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION  CHARACTERIZED BY
    HEADACHED, DIZZINESS,NAUSEA AND CONFUSTION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:TOLUENE HAS BEEN FOUND TO CAUSE KIDNEY,
    LUNG AND SPLEEN DAMAGE IN LARORATORY ANIMALS.
Effects of Overexposure:REPEATED EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA MAY
    CAUSE LUNG DISEASE. (PNEUMOCONIOSIS)OVEREXPOSURE TO TOLUENE MAY
    CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE. OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS WITH PERMANENT
    BRAIN/NERVOUS SYSTEM DAMAGE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PREXISTING RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS
    MAY BE AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:SWALLOWING-DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING. GET MED ATTN.
    INHALATION-REMOVE TO FRESH AIR AND GET MED ATTN. EYE-FLUSH WITH
    WATER FOR 15 MIN. GET MED ATTN. SKIN REMOVE CONTAMINATED CLOTHING,
    WASH AFFECTED AREA I F IRRITATION PERSISTS GET MED ATTN: NOTETO
    PHYSICIAN-ANY TREATMENT THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR OVEREXPOSURE
    SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT THE CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS AND THE CLINICAL
    CONDITIONS.
