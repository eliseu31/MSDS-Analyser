=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:EYE & SKIN IRRITATION: HIGH
    CONCENTRATIONS MAY CAUSE ACUTE CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM DEPRESSION
    CHARACTERIZED BY HEADACHE, DIZZINESS, NAUSEA & CONFUSION.
    SWALLOWING: GASTROINTESTINAL IRRITATION, ASPIRATI ON OF MATERIAL
    INTO LUNGS MAY CAUSE CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:TOLUENE HAS BEEN FOUND TO CAUSE KIDNEY,
    LUNG & SPLEEN DAMAGE IN LABORATORY ANIMALS
Effects of Overexposure:REPEATED EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA MAY
    CAUSE LUNG DISEASE. (PNEUMOCONIOSIS) OVEREXPOSURE TO TOLUENE MAY
    CAUSE LIVER DAMAGE. OVEREXPOSURE TO SOLVENTS MAY CAUSE PERMANENT
    BRAIN & NERVOUS SYSTEM DAM AGE.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:PRE-EXISTING RESPIRATORY CONDITIONS
    MAY BE AGGRAVATED BY EXPOSURE TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH WITH WATER FOR 15 MINUTES. SKIN: REMOVE
    CONTAMINATED CLOTHING, WASH AFFECTED AREA, IF IRRITATION PERSIST,
    GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. INHALATION: REMOVE TO FRESH AIR & GET
    MEDICAL ATTENTION. IN GESTION: DO NOT INDUCE VOMITING, GET MEDICAL
    ATTENTION. NOTE TO DR.:ANY TREATMENT THAT MIGHT BE REQUIRED FOR
    OVEREXPOSURE SHOULD BE DIRECTED AT THE CONTROL OF SYMPTOMS & THE
    CLINICAL CONDITIONS.
