=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:NO  Ingestion:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:OVEREXPOSURE-NAUSEA, HEADACHE,
    DIZZINESS CAUSED BY OVER INHALATION. HIGH VAPOR CONCENTRATIONS (>
    THAN APPROXIMATELY 1000 PPM) ARE IRRITATING TO THE EYES AND THE
    RESPIRATORY TRACT MAY CAUSE HEADACHES A ND DIZZINESS, ARE
    ANESTHETIC, AND MAY HAVE OTHER CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM EFFECTS.
