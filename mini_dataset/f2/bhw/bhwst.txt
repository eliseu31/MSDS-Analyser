=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:ASPIRATION OF MATERIAL INTO THE LUNGS
    CAN CAUSE CHEMICAL PNEUMONITIS WHICH CAN  BE FATAL. REPEATED EXPSR
    TO CRYSTALLINE SILICA MAY CAUSE PNEUMOCONIOSIS A DISABLING LUNG
    DISEASE. PROLONGED/REPEATED OVR EXPSR MAY CAUSE PERMANENT BRAIN &
    NERVSSYS DAMAGE. INTENTIONAL MISUSE CAN BE HARMFUL OR FATAL.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:AT TLV THE TI02 MANUFACTURER CONCLUDES
    THAT THERE IS NO	 SIGNIFICIANT HAZARD FOR MAN.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:102F/38.89C
Extinguishing Media:USE NFPA CLASS B FIRE EXTINGUISHERS,CARBON
    DIOXIDE,DRY CHEMICAL,ALCOHOL FOAM. POLYMER FOAM IS PREFERRED FOR
    LG. FIRES
Fire Fighting Procedures:WEAR SELF CONTAINED BREATHING APPARATUS. WATER
    MAY BE INEFFECTIVE,MAY BE USED TOCOOL EXPOSED CONTAINERS. IF WATER
    IS USED, FOG NOZZLES ARE PREFERRABLE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:KEEP CONTAINERS TIGHTLY CLOSED. ISOLATE
    FROM HEAT, ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT,SPARKS &FLAME. CLOSED CONTAINERS
    MAY EXPLODE WHEN EXPOSED TO EXTREME HEAT.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ELIMINATE ALL IGNITION SOURCES. DIKE/CONTAIN
    SPILLW/INERT MATL. PLACE ABSORBENT DIKING MATL IN COVERED METAL
    CONTNR FOR DISPOSAL. USE ONLY NON SPARKNGTOOLS. PREVENT CONTAM. OF
    SEWERS, GROUNDWATER, AND STREAMS W/SPILLED MATL OR USED ABSORBENT.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:DO NOT STORE ABOVE 95F. CLOSE CONTNR
    AFTER EACH	 USE. EMPTY CONTNRS MUST NOT BE WASHED/REUSED FOR 
    NEVER USE PRESSURE TO EMPTY.
