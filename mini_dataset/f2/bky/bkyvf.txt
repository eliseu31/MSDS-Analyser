=====================  Hazards Identification  =====================

Routes of Entry: Inhalation:YES  Skin:YES  Ingestion:YES
Reports of Carcinogenicity:NTP:NO    IARC:NO	OSHA:NO
Health Hazards Acute and Chronic:CHEMICALS ARE IN A SEALED CAN.
    EXPOSURE OCCURS WHEN BATTERY HAS BEEN ABUSED. DME IS SLIGHTLY TO
    MODERATELY TOXIC. EC & BC ARE IRRITATING TO EYES.  LICF3SO3 IS
    IRRITATING TO SKIN, EYES & MUCOUS MEMBRAN ES. CONTACT OF
    ELECTROLYTE & EXTRUDED LITHIUM W/SKIN & EYES SHOULD BE AVOIDED.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:MFR GAVE THE ABOVE LISTINGS ON THE MSDS
    BUT NO OTHER COMMENTS WERE RECORDED.
Effects of Overexposure:DMD MAY BE A REPRODUCTIVE HAZARD. LITHIUM CAN
    CAUSE THERMAL & CHEMICAL BURNS ON CONTACT W/SKIN.
Medical Cond Aggravated by Exposure:AN ACUTE EXPOSURE WILL GENERALLY
    NOT AGGRAVATE ANY MEDICAL CONDITION.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:FOR CONTACT OF BATTERY INTERNALS WITH-SKIN:FLUSH IMMEDIATELY
    W/WATER. -EYES:FLUSH WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF WATER FOR 15 MINUTES.
    IF IRRITATION PERSISTS, GET MEDICAL ATTENTION. DO NOT INHALE VENTED
    MATE RIAL.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point:NONE
Extinguishing Media:WATER
Fire Fighting Procedures:IN CASE OF FIRE IN AN ADJACENT AREA, USE
    WATER, CO2 OR SRY CHEMICAL EXTINGUISHERS IF CELL ARE PACKED IN
    THEIR ORIGIONAL CONTAINERS SINCE THE FUEL IS PAPER.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:FOR BULK QUANTITIES OF UNPACKAGED CELL US
    LITH-X (GRAPHITE BASE). IN THIS CASE USE NO WATER.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:THE PREFERRED RESPONSE IS TO LEAVE AREA AND
    ALLOW BATTERIES TO COOL AND VAPORS TO DISSIPATE. AVOID SKIN & EYE
    CONTACT OR INHALATION OF VAPORS. REMOVE SPILLED LIQUID W/ABSORBENT
    & INCINERATE.
Neutralizing Agent:MFR GAVE NO INFORMATION ON MSDS.

Ventilation:NOT NESCESSARY UNDER CONDITIONS OF NORMAL USE.
Protective Gloves:NOT NESCESSARY UNDER CONDITIONS OF NORMA
Eye Protection:NOT NESCESSARY UNDER CONDITIONS OF NORMA
Other Protective Equipment:NOT NESCESSARY UNDER CONDITIONS OF NORMAL
    USE.
Work Hygienic Practices:MFR:?  HMIS:USE GOOD INDUSTRIAL HYGIENE
    PRACTICE. IF HANDLING LEAKING BATTERIES USE STRICT CHEMICAL HYGIENE
    PRACTICE.
