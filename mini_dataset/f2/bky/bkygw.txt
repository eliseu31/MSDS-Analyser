=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:EYES: FLUSH W/PLENTY OF WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINS. SKIN:
    FLUSH W/WATER. FOLLOW BY WASHING W/SOAP & WATER. INHALATION: REMOVE
    TO FRESH AIR/PROVIDE OXYGEN IF BREATHING IS DIFFICULT. INGESTION:
    DON'T IN DUCE VOMITING. KEEP HEAD BELOW HIPS TO PREVENT ASPIRATION
    OF LIQUID INTO THE LUNGS. OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION IN ALL CASES.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Flash Point Method:SCC
Flash Point:164F
Extinguishing Media:WATER FOG, ALCOHOL FOAM, DRY CHEMICAL, CO2
Fire Fighting Procedures:DON'T ENTER CONFINED FIRE SPACE W/O FULL
    BUNKER GEAR/A POSITIVE PRESSURE NIOSH APPROVED SCBA. USE WATER TO
    KEEP FIRE-EXPOSED CONTAINERS COOL.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:CLOSED CONTAINERS MAY RUPTURE, VENT, DUE
    TO HEAT OR FLAMES & SHOULD BE COOLED W/WATER TO PREVENT VAPOR
    PRESSURE BUILDUP.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:ELIMINATE ALL SOURCES OF IGNITION. SHUT OFF
    LEAK IF SAFE TO DO SO. FLUSH AREA W/WATER TO REMOVE TRACE RESIDUE;
    DISPOSE OF FLUSH SOLUTION AS ABOVE. SMALL SPILLS: TAKE UP W/AN
    ABSORBENT MATERIAL & PLACE	IN NON-LEAKING CONTAINER FOR PROPER
    DISPOSAL.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP CONTAINERS CLOSED WHEN NOT IN
    USE. VAPORS MAY ACCUMULATE & TRAVEL TO IGNITION SOURCES DISTANT
    FROM HANDLING SITE & FLASH FIRE CAN RESULT.
Other Precautions:DISCARD CONTAIMINATED LEATHER ITEMS. EMPTY CONTAINERS
    RETAIN HAZARDOUS PRODUCT RESIDUES. DON'T CUT, DRILL, GRIND, WELD,
    PERFORM SIMILAR OPERATIONS ON/NEAR CONTAINERS. BOND/GROUND TRANSFER
    CONTAINERS/E QUIPMENT. AVOID CONTACT W/SKIN & EYES.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:IF >TLV, USE A NIOSH-APPROVED RESPIRATOR TO
    PREVENT OVEREXPOSURE. USE EITHER A FULL FACE, ATMOSPHERE-SUPPLYING
    RESPIRATOR OR AN AIR-PURIFYING RESPIRATOR FOR ORGANIC VAPORS.
Ventilation:USE EXPLOSION-PROOF VENTILATION AS REQUIRED TO CONTROL
    VAPOR CONCENTRATIONS
Protective Gloves:CHEMICAL-RESISTANT
Eye Protection:GOGGLES, FACESHIELD
Other Protective Equipment:EYE WASH FOUNTAIN, SAFETY SHOWERS, RUBBER
    BOOTS, BUNKER COATS
Work Hygienic Practices:WASH CONTAMINATED CLOTHING BEFORE REUSE. WASH
    W/SOAP & WATER BEFORE EATING, DRINKING, SMOKING, APPLYING
    COSMETICS.
Supplemental Safety and Health
AVOID BREATHING VAPOR OR MISTS. NOTE TO PHYSICIAN: IF >2.0 ML/KG HAS
