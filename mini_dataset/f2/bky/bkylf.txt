Supplemental Safety and Health
ONE RECOMMENDED WAY TO DETERMINE THE COMPOSITION/QUANTITY OF FUMES &
    GASES TO WHICH WORKERS ARE EXPOSED IS TO TAKE AN AIR SAMPLE FROM
    INSIDE THE WELDER'S HELMET OR IN THE WORKER'S BREATHING ZONE. COMP
    OSITION/QUANTITY OF FUMES/GASES ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE METAL BEING
    WELDED & THE PROCESS/PROCEDURES/ELECTRODES USED.
