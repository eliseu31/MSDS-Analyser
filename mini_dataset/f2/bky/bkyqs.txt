    TASTE IN MOUTH/DRYNESS/THROAT IRRITATION/INFLUENZA-LIKE
    SYMPTOMS/METAL FUME FEVER. SKIN: HIGH CONCENTRATION OF DUST/FUMES
    CAUSES SENSITIZATION DERMATITIS/TITANIU M DUST MAY CAUSE PHYSICAL
    ABRASION.
Explanation of Carcinogenicity:SEE INGREDIENTS.
Effects of Overexposure:INHALATION: INFLAMMATION & ULCERATION OF UPPER
    RESPIRATORY TRACT & POSSIBLE CANCER OF NASAL PASSAGES & LUNGS.

=======================  First Aid Measures  =======================

First Aid:INHALATION: IF EXPOSED TO EXCESSIVE LEVELS OF METAL FUMES,
    REMOVE TO FRESH AIR. TREAT AS A NUISANCE DUST. EYES/SKIN: FLUSH
    W/WATER FOR AT LEAST 15 MINS. OBTAIN MEDICAL ATTENTION IN ALL
    CASES.

=====================  Fire Fighting Measures  =====================

Extinguishing Media:DRY CHEMICAL POWDERS, SALTS OR INERT GAS. DON'T USE
    WATER OR LIQUID; EXPLOSION HAZARD COULD RESULT.
Fire Fighting Procedures:KEEP WORK AREAS FREE OF THE WASTE.
Unusual Fire/Explosion Hazard:PRODUCT DOESN'T BURN. HOWEVER,
    GRINDING/POLISHING PRODUCT IN ABSENCE OF OXYGEN, SUCH AS UNDER
    WATER CAN CAUSE A FINELY DIVIDED WASTE WHICH IS IGNITABLE.

==================  Accidental Release Measures  ==================

Spill Release Procedures:USE NON-SPARKING METAL EQUIPMENT.

======================	Handling and Storage  ======================

Handling and Storage Precautions:KEEP WORK AREAS FREE OF THE WASTE.
    IGNITABLE WASTE: STORE WET, AWAY FROM HEAT/OPEN FLAME. MAINTAIN
    HUMIDITY >50% TO PREVENT AN ELECTROSTATIC BUILD-UP.
Other Precautions:NO SMOKING IN AREA. METALLIC DUST OR FUMES MAY BE
    PRODUCED DURING WELDING, BURNING, GRINDING & POSSIBLY MACHINING.
    AVOID INHALATION OF PARTICULATES.

=============  Exposure Controls/Personal Protection  =============

Respiratory Protection:NIOSH-MSHA APPROVED DUST/FUME, RESPIRATOR SHOULD
